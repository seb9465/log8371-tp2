Viruses have been considered to be likely candidates since the recognition of the association between intrauterine rubella and congenital heart disease. Although the pathogenesis of cardiovascular defects is poorly understood, information gained from the study of congenital rubella syndrome suggests that mechanisms such as focal endothelial cell damage, resulting in obliteration of vascular supply, decreased growth rate, and shortened survival time of certain cells, and disturbed DNA replication in cells whose chromosomes were damaged secondary to the effects of virus replication may be operative in the production of defects in the developing fetus. In addition to rubella there is suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence that Coxsackie B3 and B4 virus infections during pregnancy can result in the birth of infants with a variety of types of congenital heart lesions and that intrauterine mumps virus infection may be etiologically related to the postnatal development of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE). Although there are a number of other viruses that are potential etiologic agents of congenital heart disease, the current status of information is inadequate to allow even suggestive associations to be made. The most profitable areas for future investigation appear to be: (1) the epidemiology of congenital heart disease, (2) prospective studies of the association of maternal viral infection with abnormal offspring, (3) the in-depth virologic investigation of the infant with a cardiac defect, and (4) the development of experimental animal models of congenital heart disease. Successful control of virus-induced congenital heart disease will depend on the results of these investigations and the development of vaccines against the identified causative viruses and/or safe and effective antiviral chemotherapy for the woman in early gestation who is infected with a known teratogenic agent.",1972-12-31,"Overall, James C.",American Heart Journal,,,False,custom_license

It is estimated that each adult in the United States experiences two to four respiratory infections annually. The morbidity of these infections is measured by an estimated 75 million physician visits per year, almost 150 million days lost from work, and more than $10 billion In costs for medical care. Serotypes of the rhinoviruses account for 20 to 30 percent of episodes of the common cold. However, the specific causes of most upper respiratory infections are undefined. Pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality for nonhospitalized adults despite the widespread use of effective antimicrobial agents. There are no accurate figures on the number of episodes of pneumonia that occur each year in ambulatory patients. In younger adults, the atypical pneumonia syndrome Is the most common clinical presentation; Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most frequently Identified causative agent. Other less common agents include Legionelia pneumophila, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and Chiamydia. More than half a million adults are hospitalized each year with pneumonia. Persons older than 65 years of age have the highest rate of pneumonia admissions, 11.5 per 1,000 population. Pneumonia ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonlas are changing. Forty years ago, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for the majority of infections. Today, a broad array of community-acquired pathogens have been implicated as etiologic agents Including Leglonella species, gram-negative bacilli, Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and nonbacterial pathogens. Given the diversity of pathogenic agents, it has become imperative for clinicians to establish a specific etiologic diagnosis before initiating therapy or to consider the diagnostic possibilities and treat with antimicrobial agents that are effective against the most likely pathogens.",1985-06-28,"Garibaldi, Richard A.",The American Journal of Medicine,,,False,custom_license

New etiologic agents, mechanisms, and diseases have become known. For example, Escherichia coli serogroup 0157 is now known to cause acute hemorrhagic colitis. Also, E. coli serogroups that produce Shiga toxin are recognized as etiologic agents in the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The production of bacterial diarrhea has two major facets, bacterial-mucosal interaction and the induction of intestinal fluid loss by enterotoxins. Bacterial-mucosal interaction can be described in stages: (1) adherence to epithelial cell microvilli, which is often promoted by or associated with pill; (2) close adherence (enteroadherence), usually by classic enteropathogenic E. coli, to mucosal epithelial cells lacking microvilli; and (3) mucosal invasion, as with Shigella and Salmonella infections.

Chronic inflammatory cells then produce soluble factors that induce both tissue destruction and inflammation. A major issue is how and why apparently normal immune responses in the acute stage progress to chronic inflammation in subsequent months to years. Although it is often assumed that the initial etiologic agent, persisting in the joint or at an extra-articular site, is responsible for continued synovitis, this need not be the case. It is possible that once the inciting agent is cleared from the joint through a normal immune response, the presence of activated cells rich in surface class II histocompatibility (Ia) antigens could, under the influence of multiple genetic or environmental factors, become the target of autoimmune attack. Alternatively, the process might result from the interactions of synovial lining cells and their products with T cells assuming a secondary role. Further research into the relative contributions of soluble products, T helper and suppressor subsets, synoviocytes, and antigen determine which model is correct.",1988-10-14,"Zvaifler, Nathan J.",The American Journal of Medicine,,,True,custom_license

It is characterized by persistent cough and sputum production and is occasionally accompanied by fever and/or chest pain. Acute bronchitis may have a viral or bacterial origin and is often treated with antibiotics. Four clinical trials were conducted to compare high and low doses of loracarbef, a new oral β-lactam antibiotic, with three agents commonly used to treat acute bronchitis: amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, and amoxicillin. Results of these studies indicated that loracarbef, 400 and 200 mg twice daily, had clinical and bacteriologic efficacy against the common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis that was comparable with that of the comparative agents. Loracabef was as well tolerated as cefaclor and amoxicillin; moreover, it produced a significantly lower incidence of diarrhea than did amoxicillin/clavulanate.

Conditions were optimized for resolution and quantitation of three microsomal metabolites of LA, one of which has not been reported previously as a metabolite of LA in mammalian microsomal incubations. These products, 12-(ω)-hydroxy-LA, 11-(ω-1)-hydroxy-LA, and a novel metabolite, 10-(ω-2)-hydroxy-LA, were isolated by HPLC and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In the presence of NADPH, the formation of all three metabolites was linear with time and microsomal protein concentration. Hydrogen peroxide also supported the microsomal metabolism of LA, although the ratio of metabolites was substantially different than that produced by NADPH-supported microsomes. Several biochemical probes (metyrapone, α-naphthoflavone, 2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride, and 10-undecynoic acid) were used to dissociate the three LA hydroxylase activities. These experiments suggest that the site-specific hydroxylation [ω-, (ω-1)-, (ω-2)-] of LA may be catalyzed by different isozymes of cytochrome P-450.",1988-04-30,"Romano, Maria C.; Straub, Kenneth M.; Yodis, Lee Ann P.; Eckardt, Regina D.; Newton, John F.",Analytical Biochemistry,,,True,custom_license

In agreement with previous work, incubation of COV with valinomycin resulted in a perturbation of the absorbance spectrum of oxidized heme aa 3 in the Soret region (430 nm); gramicidin had no effect on the heme aa 3 absorbance spectrum. Different concentrations of the two ionophores were required for maximum respiratory control ratios in COV; 40- to 70-fold higher concentrations of valinomycin were required to completely uncouple electron transfer activity when compared to gramidicin. The proton translocating activity of COV incubated with each ionophore gave a similar apparent proton translocated to electron transferred stoichiometry ( H+ e− ratio) of 0.66 ± 0.10. However, COV treated with low concentrations of gramicidin (0.14 mg/g phospholipid) exhibited 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher rates of alkalinization of the extravesicular media after the initial proton translocation reaction than did COV treated with valinomycin, suggesting that gramicidin allows more rapid equilibration of protons across the phospholipid bilayer during the proton translocation assay. Moreover, at higher concentrations of gramicidin (1.4 mg/g phospholipid), the observed H+ e− ratio decreased to 0.280 ± 0.020, while the rate of alkalinization increased an additional 2-fold, suggesting that at higher concentrations, gramicidin acts as a proton ionophore. These results support the hypothesis that cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-linked proton pump that operates at similar efficiencies in the presence of either ionophore. Low concentrations of gramicidin dissipate the membrane potential in COV most likely by a channel mechanism that is different from the carrier mechanism of valinomycin, yet does not make the phospholipid bilayer freely permeable to protons.",1991-10-31,"Prochaska, Lawrence J.; Wilson, Kathryn S.",Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics,,,True,custom_license

Infection of untreated A/J animals and vehicle controls with MHV3 resulted in marked and reproducible activation of peritoneal macrophages, observed in vitro as resistance to MHV3-cytopathic effects 48 hr after rechallenge with the virus, whereas exposure to dieldrin resulted in apparent loss of the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict replication of MHV3 and to protect them from cytolysis. In addition, in vitro treatment of MHV3 virus-activated macrophages with dieldrin, mitomycin C and X-irradiation, inhibited the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict MHV3 replication. This mechanism of cellular restriction of the virus by MHV3-activated macrophages from the resistant A/J strain appeared to be one of the sensitive targets for the suppressive action of dieldrin on host resistance, as (i) no major changes in macrophage cellular parameters were observed in in vitro studies of cell viability, adherence to plastic, and Superoxide anion generation; (ii) the increased cell yield in the peritoneal exudates during MHV3 virus infection was not affected by dieldrin exposure; and (iii) the attachment and uptake of [3H]MHV3 by virus-activated macophages was shown to be unchanged by dieldrin exposure.",1986-08-01,"Krzystyniak, Krzysztof; Bernier, Jacques; Hugo, Patrice; Fournier, Michel",Biochemical Pharmacology,,,True,custom_license

The HAG derivatives [RCHNNHC(NH)NHOH-tosylate] studied could be grouped as; (1) hydroxy-benzylidines; (2) methoxybenzylidines; and (3) nitrobenzylidines substituted at the R position. 2′-Hydroxybenzylidine-HAG, the lead compound, was relatively active in both HT-29 cells and L1210 cells (20 ± 5 and 13 ± 4 μM for 50% inhibition of HT-29 and L1210 cell growth respectively). The monohydroxybenzylidene compounds were generally more active than the dihydroxy- and trihy-droxybenzylidene-HAG derivatives. The methoxybenzylidene-HAGs were as active as the monohy-droxybenzylidene-HAGs. 2′-Hydroxy-4′-methoxybenzylidene-HAG was much more active than 2′,4′-dihydroxybenzylidene-HAG. The mononitrobenzylidene-HAGs were more active than the dinitro-benzylidene-HAG compound. In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the effects of the HAG compounds than were HT-29 cells. There was good agreement between the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells and that required to inhibit the growth of L1210 cells. There was also good correlation between the ability of HAG derivatives to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity and to inhibit tumor cell growth. Some derivatives, such as 2′,3′,4′- and 3′,4′,5′-trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG inhibited L1210 cell growth by 50% at lower concentrations (7.8 and 11.9 μM respectively) than the concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of HT-29 cell growth (196 and 234 μM respectively) and ribonucleotide reductase activity (122 and 188 μM respectively). The studies of nucleic acid synthesis in L1210 cells using [3H]cytidine as a precursor showed that 2′,3′,4′-trihy-droxybenzylidine-HAG inhibited DNA synthesis at a lower concentration (29 μM for 50% inhibition) than was needed for the inhibition of RNA synthesis and formation of [3H]deoxycytidine nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction (320 and 820 μM for 50% inhibition respectively). These results indicate that 2′,3′,4′-trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG inhibits DNA synthesis in L1210 cells through other mechanisms rather than exclusively through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity.",1990-10-15,"Masahiko, Matsumoto; Fox, John G.; Pou-Hsiung, Wang; Koneru, Phanesh B.; Lien, Eric J.; Cory, Joseph G.",Biochemical Pharmacology,,,True,custom_license

Amastatin and probestin were effective against all three aminopeptidases, with the concentration of inhibitor required to cause 50% inhibition (I50) in the low micromolar range (I50 = 1.5–20 μM), except for probestin with AP-N which displayed an I50 of 50 nM. Actinonin failed to inhibit significantly either AP-A or AP-W, and thus can be considered a relatively selective inhibitor (I50 = 2.0 μM of AP-N. In contrast, bestatin was a relatively poor inhibitor of AP-N (I50 = 89 μm) and failed to inhibit AP-A, but was more potent towards AP-W (I50 = 7.9 μM). Thus, some of the observed chemotherapeutic actions of bestatin may be due to inhibition of cell-surface AP-W. A number of other metallopeptidase inhibitors, including inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) and membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11), and the carboxylalkyl and phosphoryl inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) failed to inhibit significantly AP-A, AP-N or AP-W. However, AP-W was inhibited with I50 values in the micromolar range by the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors rentiapril (I50 = 1.6 μM), zofenoprilat (I50 = 7.0 μM) and YS 980 (I50 = 17.7 μM).

Intravitreal injections of [3H]proline were given at regular intervals after virus inoculation, the labelled protein in the superior colliculi was then measured after survival periods of 18 h or 10 days, for fast and slow axonal transport studies, respectively. Fast transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein arriving at the optic nerve terminals (superior colliculus) of the SFV-infected mice prior to the onset of demyelination. In contrast, the slow transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein at the superior colliculus of the SFV-infected mice during the demyelination period. There was no concomitant increase in labelled protein in the retina at any time after the SFV infection. It is proposed that alteration in the transport of the protein constituents other than major myelin specific components may cause disruption of myelin maintenance in SFV infection.",1986-11-05,"Tansey, E.M.; Ikeda, Hisako",Brain Research,,,True,custom_license

Treatment with12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) caused cultured astrocytes to proliferate. This effect of TPA was blocked by staurosporine, a potent protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of protein kinase C in astrocyte proliferation. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation, enhanced both the normal and TPA-induced proliferation of astrocytes. Authentic prostaglandin E2 blocked this effect of indomethacin and also partially blocked the effect of TPA, suggesting that the intracellular mechanisms involved in prostaglandin E2-regulated astrocyte growth might differ from those acting in protein kinase-dependent growth. The effect of prostaglandin E2 was blocked by a specific anti-prostaglandin E2 polyclonal antibody. Cultured astrocytes and microglia produced and released prostaglandin E2 in response to stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide, TPA, and lymphokines. Since the sensitivity of astrocytes and microglia to these stimuli was different, prostaglandin E2 may differentially regulate astrocyte proliferation under different physiological conditions, acting in an autocrine fashion for astrocytes and in a paracrine fashion for microglia.",1993-06-04,"Sawada, Makoto; Suzumura, Akio; Ohno, Kazushige; Marunouchi, Tohru",Brain Research,,,True,custom_license

As reported from this laboratory, certain astrocytes in rat brain contain cisternae of the GA not only in perikarya, but also in processes. In order to further investigate which type of astrocytes contain GA in processes we conducted the present study using primary cultures of rat astrocytes and organelle specific antibodies against the GA and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). While the perikarya of all cells contained elements of the GA, only a single process of a subset of type I astrocytes, negative to antibodies A2B5 and HNK-1, contained GA. In contrast, elements of the RER were found within perikarya and all processes. In order to confirm that the immunostained structures in processes indeed represent the GA, we exposed cultures to Brefeldin A (BFA), a secretion blocker which disperses the GA and redistributes it to the RER. We observed that BFA disrupted the GA of both perikarya and processes. However, astrocytes were resistant to prolonged incubations with BFA, while a similar treatment killed cultured fibroblasts and PC-12 cells. Furthermore, in astrocytes exposed to BFA for several days, the delicate network of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), was replaced by large perinuclear masses of the protein. These observations demonstrate that a subset of type I astrocytes have a single process with elements of the GA. We suggest that this specialization of the GA may be related to yet unrecognized secretory or protein processing functions of these cells. The resistance of astrocytes to BFA and the striking changes in their cytoskeleton induced by the drug, may contribute to studies on the mechanism(s) of action of BFA.",1994-06-06,"Lavi, Ehud; Wang, Qian; Stieber, Anna; Gonatas, Nicholas K.",Brain Research,,,True,custom_license

To study the functions of GM-CSF in the central nervous system (CNS), we examined the effects of GM-CSF on cytokine production by glial cells. GM-CSF induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by microglia, but not by astrocytes, in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by bioassay and the detection of IL-6 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. GM-CSF did not induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a or IL-1 in microglia and astrocytes, whereas lipopolysaccharide induced all these cytokines. The induction of IL-6 by GM-CSF in microglia was completely inhibited by antibodies to GM-CSF. Neither IL-3 nor macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) induced IL-6 production in microglia. Given that IL-1 and TNFα, monokines derived from microglia, induce IL-6 production in astrocytes, but not in microglia, results indicate that astrocytes and microglia may mutually regulate IL-6 production by different cytokines.",1996-03-25,"Suzumura, Akio; Sawada, Makoto; Marunouchi, Tohru",Brain Research,,,True,custom_license

Purified viral particles were spherical in shape and measured 90 nm in average diameter in negatively stained preparations. Pleomorphic forms were also present. The virions had envelopes with petal-shaped projections characteristic of coronaviruses. In ultrathin sections, cores in viral factories were round with a diameter of 50–60 nm. Most of these cores were electron dense but some had an electron-lucent center. In cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, and on the apical plasmalemma of intestinal epithelial cells, the virions were round or ellipsoidal in shape, measuring 70–80 nm in diameter, and had fine thread-like projections on their surfaces. Uptake of virus occurred through fusion of viral envelopes with the plasmalemma of the microvillous border or by entry into intercellular spaces and interaction with the lateral cell membranes of adjacent intestinal epithelial cells. As a result of this interaction, the lateral cell membranes became altered and ill-defined. During the early stage of infection, the rough andasmooth elements of the endoplasmic reticulum became distended with electron-dense granulofibrillar material. This material accumulated subsequently as well-defined, smooth membrane-bound areas mainly in the apical cytoplasm of infected cells. These structures were considered to be viral factories. The morphogenesis of virus occurred mainly through condensation of the electron-dense, granulo-fibrillar material into viral cores in cytoplasmic viral factories or within the distended cisternes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Viral envelopment occurred on membranes of cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, or in association with membranes of viral factories. Release of virus from infected cells occurred by lysis and fragmentation of the apical plasmalemma and flow of the cytoplasm with its contents into the gut lumen. Release also occurred by digestion and lysis of extruded infected cells or by fusion of virus-containing cytoplasmic vacuoles with the apical plasmalemma and liberation of their contents.",1976-12-31,"Doughri, A.M.; Storz, J.; Hajer, I.; Fernando, H.S.",Experimental and Molecular Pathology,,,False,custom_license

The course of infection was determined by clinical symptoms of diarrhea and virus isolation as well as histopathological, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic methods. Both isolates were able to replicate and produce clinical symptoms in neonatal mice. Rotavirus-free neonates were orally inoculated with MRV or BRV and observed over a 192-hr postinoculation (HPI) period. Following infection with 104 PFU of virus, diarrhea and maximal intestinal dysfunction, as measured by xylose absorption, did not occur until beyond 20 hr postinfection even though maximal virus production occurred at 10–15 HPI. Immunohistochemically and by electron microscopy we were able to demonstrate viral antigen and virus particles in the enterocytes of villous tips at 5–8 HPI. The appearance of diarrheal symptoms was dependent on the virus dose and the type of virus isolate inoculated. The disease could be induced with doses as low as 1 × 102 PFU/mouse of BRV and 1 × 101 PFU/mouse of MRV. On the basis of these results, MRV was found to be more virulent than BRV in this model.

Cytoplasmic fluorescence was first observed at 12 hr postinfection (h.p.i) in infected HRT-18 cultures. This fluorescence coincided with the appearance of cell surface antigen reacting with colloidal gold-labeled antibodies to BCV antigens. At 24 h.p.i the amount of viral antigens at the surface of HRT-18 had increased, although cytoplasmic fluorescence remained constant. Infected BFS cells but not HRT-18 cells formed polykaryons when incubated in the presence of trypsin. One viral antigen in the plasma membrane of BFS cells was thus identified as the S glycoprotein with a fusion domain. In contrast to HRT-18 cells, the overall amount of BCV antigens at the surface of BFS cells remained constant after the onset of fusion. Analysis of the labeling characteristics established that the goldmarked-sites represented de novo expression of BCV antigen in the plasma membrane of infected cells.",1990-10-31,"Payne, H.R.; Storz, J.; Henk, W.G.",Experimental and Molecular Pathology,,,True,custom_license

The conjugate with conA was bound to L cells in the absence of, but not in the presence of α-methyl mannoside. Incubation of L cells with bound conjugates did not produce virus, although the conjugates were highly infectious in HeLa cells, containing natural poliovirus receptors. This suggests that the artificially bound virus was unable to penetrate the L cells and start replication.

In the present work, bovine and rat rhodopsin were analysed biochemically for the presence of a third sugar, galactose. Treatment of bovine rod outer segments (ROS) with galactose oxidase followed by reduction with tritium-labeled sodium borohydride revealed the presence of existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin. Rats injected intravitreally with [3H]galactose and [14C]leucine and maintained in darkness were killed 1 hr, 6 hr, 1, 3, or 5 days following the injection. Retinas were collected for subcellular fractionation and rhodopsin from each of the fractions was purified by ConA sepharose chromatography and SDS-PAGE. During the first 6 hr, galactose selectively labeled rhodopsin in the Golgi-enriched fraction resulting in increased [3H] [14C] ratios in both Golgi and ROS. The data suggested that trimming was occurring at the transition from Golgi to ROS. Furthermore, a decrease in isotope ratio in the ROS between 6 hr and 1 day suggested further trimming of rhodopsin after membrane assembly in the ROS. Additional in vivo experiments demonstrated existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin's oligosaccharide chain using lectin affinity chromatography. Rats injected intravitreally with [35S]methionine were dark-adapted for 2 hr. Following subcellular fractionation of retinas, ConA purified rhodopsin from ROS was applied to one of two additional lectin columns: Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) or Griffonia simplicifolia I (GSA). Eight to nine per cent of the labeled rhodopsin was bound to and eluted from RCA, whereas none bound to GSA, indicating the presence of a β-galactoside. The RCA agarose eluted protein co-electrophoresed with a rhodopsin standard and was light sensitive. Galactose was shown to be the terminal sugar on this subset of rhodopsin and was not capped by neuraminic acid. Binding of rhodopsin's oligosaccharide to RCA was abolished by pre-treatment with β-galactosidase. Decreased binding of rhodopsin to RCA was observed following intravitreal injection of castanospermine but not swainsonine. Of those two inhibitors of glycoprotein trimming, only castanospermine would be expected to prevent the addition of galactose to the oligosaccharide. The association of galactose with rat rhodopsin appeared to be a transient one. At 2 hr, 8–9% of rhodopsin contained galactose, at 6 hr only 2·2% had galactose and by 24 hr less than 1% did. The galactose was trimmed from rhodopsin's oligosaccharide presumably after its role was complete. Separation of rhodopsin of the plasma membranes from rhodopsin of discs indicated that 75% of the galactose-containing rhodopsin was in the plasma membrane and only 25% was in the discs. These findings suggested a possible role for galactose in new disc formation with subsequent removal after the discs are sealed.",1991-10-31,"Smith, Sylvia B.; St Jules, Robert S.; O'Brien, Paul J.",Experimental Eye Research,,,True,custom_license

In the first few weeks after nerve lesions we observed a gradual increase in the number of Ia-immunoreactive cells starting with an initial appearance of Ia-positive perivascular cells which were succeeded by increasing numbers of Ia-positive ramified microglia. In long-term animals Ia expression was almost exclusively found in microglia. We propose (a) the existence of a population of immunocompetent perivascular cells normally present in adult rat brain that can be stimulated to express Ia antigen, and (b) the existence of a subpopulation of ramified microglia that arises through transformation of Ia-positive perivascular cells in the adult under pathological conditions.",1989-08-31,"Streit, Wolfgang J.; Graeber, Manuel B.; Kreutzberg, Georg W.",Experimental Neurology,,,True,custom_license

Complete inhibition with okadaic acid at 0.9–4.5 μM but not at 1–10 nM relegates this PPase to a type I protein phosphatase. Similar PPPase activity for N was present in the endosome fraction of a rat Roc-1 astrocytoma-oligodendrocyte cell line and in homogenates of brain and cultured oligodendrocytes.

Daily recordings, 7 h in duration, were made from each piglet beginning 3 days after surgery. Characteristic migrating motility complexes and short, distinct (2.5–5.0 s), rapidly aboral migrating bursts of intense spike activity (“migrating action potential complexes”) were seen in all preinfection recordings. Piglets were inoculated with a 1-ml oral dose of a 0.1% gut suspension from coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis) infected pigs. This resulted in inappetence, vomiting, and diarrhea, most marked on the second day postinfection, but which had abated by the third day. When compared to recordings from both fed and fasted noninfected (control) animals, infection significantly altered jejunal myoelectrical activity by (a) shortening the duration of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and prolonging it on day 2, (b) increasing the number of abnormal activity fronts, and (c) decreasing the number of migrating action potential complexes. Slow wave frequency and the duration of phase 3 of the migrating motility complex were unaffected. When compared to fed control animals, infected piglets also showed a slight shortening of phase 1 of the migrating motility complex on day 1 postinfection and a prolongation on days 2 and 3, as well as a shortening of phase 2 on the second and third days postinfection. Changes in myoelectrical activity were not solely due to decreases in food intake, as abnormalities persisted when food intake returned to normal on postinfection day 3, and disruption of the activity front and migrating motility complex duration were purely transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus-induced phenomena.

A research priority of the World Health Organization is to develop oral rehydration solutions containing amino acids or other additives that will stimulate intestinal absorption more efficiently than the current glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. Glutamine is the principal metabolic fuel of the small bowel and a putative stimulator of mucosal repair. This report describes the transport response to mucosal l-glutamine following intestinal injury caused by porcine rotavirus. Peak symptoms and mucosal damage were observed 2–7 days after oral rotavirus inoculation. In vitro transport studies of the maximally injured region, the midjejunum (80% reduction in lactase), surprisingly, showed transport responses to l-glutamine (30 mmol/L) Sand l-alanine (30 mmol/L) that were similar qualitatively and quantitatively to those observed in control tissue. Subsequent application of mucosal d-glucose (30 mmol/L) caused additional stimulation of electrogenic Na+ transport, but the response to glucose was blunted (P < 0.05) in the infected tissues. Glutamine and alanine enhanced Na+ absorption to a similar degree (2–2.5 μEq · cm−2 · h−1), but glutamine stimulated equal amounts of electrogenic and electroneutral NaC1 absorption, whereas alanine had no significant effect on net Cl− flux.

In infected piglets, although the jejunum exhibited severe villus atrophy, both drugs stimulated Na+ and Cl− absorption and the magnitude of Na+ and Cl− absorption was similar in control and transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum. In contrast, d-glucose stimulated Na+ absorption, and the decrease in shortcircuit current caused by verapamil and clonidine, were decreased in transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum. Such pharmacological stimulation of Na+ and Cl− absorption might be useful in the management and treatment of certain viral diarrheal diseases.",1991-10-31,"Homaidan, Fadia R.; Torres, Alfonso; Donowitz, Mark; Sharp, Geoffrey W.G.",Gastroenterology,,,True,custom_license

In the first a husband, wife, and 4 children had Crohn's disease; in the second 7 of 11 children had the disease. There was no history of Crohn's disease in antecedent generations and no linkage to HLA haplotypes. Methods: Methods included family interviews; review of medical records, radiographs, and pathology slides; serology; selective stool culture; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for fecal viral detection; and immunocytochemistry. Results: In both families multiple cases occurred among siblings in 7–13-month periods. There appeared to be a 4–8-year recurrence of new disease in both families. Radiographs showed a remarkable similarity in the pattern of disease, confined to distal ileum and cecum, in the members of family 1. Examination for pathology showed granulomas in all 8 patients for whom tissues were available. Acid-fast organisms or Campylobacter-like organisms were not found in tissue sections, and immunocytochemistry was negative for mycobacteria and Yersinia. Stool cultures were negative for mycobacteria, Yersinia, and Mycoplasma. Torovirus and coronavirus antigens were not found in stool. Serology was negative for antibodies to Brucella, Yersinia, influenza, and three enteropathogenic viruses of animals.

The objective of this study was to search for likely microbial agents in diseased tissues using immunocytochemical techniques. Methods Intestines and mesenteric lymph node specimens of 21 patients from two French families with a high frequency of Crohn's disease and from Connecticut were studied. The microbial agents searched for included Bacteroides vulgatus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Escherichia coil, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus spp., bovine viral diarrhea virus, influenza A virus, measles virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Results Seventy-five percent of the patients with Crohn's disease (12 of 16) were positively labeled with the antibody to Listeria. Macrophages and giant cells immunolabeled for this antigen were distributed underneath ulcers, along fissures, around abscesses, within the lamina propria, in granulomas, and in the germinal centers of mesenteric lymph nodes. In addition, 57% (12 of 21) of the cases contained the E. coli antigen, and 44% (7 of 16) contained the streptococcal antigen. The immunolabeling for the latter two agents also occurred within macrophages and giant cells, distributed in a pattern similar to that of Listeria antigen.

From this, B. caballi antigens were extracted with the detergent 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS) and used as ELISA antigens. A control antigen of normal erythrocytes from the same donor horse was prepared in an identical manner. The ELISA and Western blot were validated by testing of sera from horses experimentally infected with B. caballi or B. equi or not infected with Babesia spp. ELISA and Western blot results were compared with those obtained by the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and complement fixation test (CFT). The sensitivity of the ELISA of 98.3% obtained for sera from day 14 after infection was superior to the Western blot (94.9%), the IFAT (96.6%) and the CFT (28.8%). No positive results were obtained in the ELISA and Western blot with 106 sera from horses not infected with Babesia spp. resulting in a calculated specificity of 100% for both tests. Cross reactions of B. equi-positive sera did occur to a larger extent in the ELISA (20%) than in the IFAT (4%). No cross reactions were observed with the Western blot and the CFT. The higher sensitivity of the ELISA was also demonstrated by testing of 132 field sera: more positive results were obtained by ELISA (112) as compared to IFAT (92) or CFT (41). The validity of these results was confirmed by testing of sera by Western blot. The ELISA as the most sensitive test provides the best method for the identification of carrier horses to prevent the introduction into non-endemic areas (export testing).

The T strain of the virus caused only mild respiratory signs in both Rhode Island Red (RIR) and White Leghorn (WL) breeds; the 50 per cent mortality induced was due to acute nephritis. All the infected birds developed high titres of antibody to IBV for up to 30 weeks. In spite of the persistence of antibody, about 35 per cent of the RIR developed chronic progressive nephritis. The histology showed varying degrees of pathological changes in the tubules, with relatively unaffected glomeruli. Foci of mononuclear cell infiltration were prominent in the cortex and medulla, particularly in chronic nephritis. Cytoplasmic IBV immunofluorescence was found in all segments of the tubules, but not in the glomeruli. There was no evidence of virus replication in the caecal tonsil and bursa of Fabricius. Evidence of extensive coronavirus replication was found in the cells of the tubules.

All mice inoculated i.c. with a large dose of virus died regardless of age, although a smaller dose caused fatal infection only in suckling mice. By intranasal, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous inoculation, the virus also killed suckling mice under 16 days old, but not older mice, even with a large dose. The susceptibility of mice for the MB-67N strain was influenced by age and inoculation routes. High titres of virus were re-isolated from the brain of diseased mice after inoculation by any route, but not from other organs. Histologically, numerous areas of severe tocal necrosis were produced in the cerebral cortex. Specific immuno-fluorescence and numerous viral particles were found in the cytoplasm of nerve cells by immuno-fluorescence staining and electron microscopy.

Calves were monitored from days 1 to 5, and on day 6 (neonates) or 8 (weanlings) and, in a second trial at day 4·5, by histology, electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry and virus isolation. Mucosal lesions of neonates were similar to, but less extensive than, those of weanling calves. Loss of microvilli and goblet cells, with minimal epithelial erosions as early as day 1, progressed to necrosis of epithelium and adjacent lymphoid tissue, and leucocyte exudation. Lesions and clinical disease were progressive up to and including day 6 in neonates, but resolving in weanlings on days 5 and 8. By transmission electron microscopy, the physical characteristics of the phagocytic cells appeared similar in both age groups, and viral replication was not identified in leucocytes. Virus was isolated from, or found by immunocytochemistry in, the pharyngeal tonsil of all calves examined, except for two weanlings on days 1 and 8. Virus as detected by immunocytochemistry was restricted to epithelium and superficial lymphoid tissue in neonates, but was found in deep lymphoid tissue around germinal centres in weanlings. The study showed that the pharyngeal tonsil is readily infected with BHV-1 and may be an important lymphoid tissue for early anti-viral responses. The delayed inflammatory response and reduced viral clearance may contribute to the increased susceptibility of neonatal calves to fatal BHV-1 infections.",1992-04-30,"Schuh, J.C.L.; Bielefeldt Ohmann, H.; Babiuk, L.A.; Doige, C.E.",Journal of Comparative Pathology,,,False,custom_license

Antispecies antibody that has been iodinated detects coronavirus antigen expression for 24 days post-inoculation while it is only detectable for 10 days by immunofluorescence. A direct comparison of indirect fluorescence and autoradiographic methods indicates that the autoradiographic techniques are considerably more sensitive. This increased sensitivity is sufficient to permit the detection of viral antigen in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections.,1982-10-29,"Gerdes, J.C.; McNally, I.; Hileman, L.; Burks, J.S.",Journal of Immunological Methods,,,True,custom_license

MCAs with optimal characteristics for application in ELISA were selected and used as conjugates in an indirect double antibody sandwich assay (IDAS) and as the capturing antibody in an antibody capture assay (ACA) for the isotype-specific detection of antibodies against rotavirus. Based on theoretical grounds, experimental analysis of inter- and intra-isotype competition in IDAS and ACA, respectively, and direct comparison of both tests, the IDAS was selected for the detection of IgG1 and IgG2 anti-rotavirus antibodies. The ACA was the test of choice for the detection of IgM and IgA anti-rotavirus antibodies. The isotype specificity of these tests relies on the specificity of the MCAs and was confirmed for each test by the observation that samples containing rotavirus antibodies of only 1 particular isotypee reacted only in the homologous assay.

After oral immunization with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus, antibody production from primed mesenteric lymph node cells was revealed by an in vitro boost with viral antigen. For the latter the leukocytes were co-cultured with UV-inactivated virus using a variety of different methods of antigenic stimulation. Enumeration of specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and titration of secreted anti-virus antibodies were performed with ELISASPOT (using 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole as the peroxidase chromogen) and ELISA tests respectively, according to the Ig isotype. The results showed a close relationship between ASC numbers and secreted antibody titres. The best in vitro antibody synthesis was observed when the sensitized cells were maintained in contact with virus during the whole culture period. Antibody responses were defined by a kinetic profile characterized by a narrow peak, with a maximum occuring after 4 and 6 days of culture and with the IgA response appearing earlier than the IgG. This methodology, which analyses specific antibody responses at the cellular level, may permit studies on the mechanisms of Ig isotype regulation.

Thus, E2 belongs to a glycoprotein type found in many other enveloped viruses. E1, in contrast, represents a different class of glycoprotein. The following observations indicate that its carbohydrate side-chains have 0-glycosidic linkage. (1) The constituent sugars of E1 are N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and neuraminic acid; mannose and fucose are absent. (2) The side-chains can be removed by β-elimination.

Local alignments are frequently constructed with the aid of a “substitution score matrix” that specifies a score for aligning each pair of amino acid residues. Over the years, many different substitution matrices have been proposed, based on a wide variety of rationales. Statistical results, however, demonstrate that any such matrix is implicitly a “log-odds” matrix, with a specific target distribution for aligned pairs of amino acid residues. In the light of information theory, it is possible to express the scores of a substitution matrix in bits and to see that different matrices are better adapted to different purposes. The most widely used matrix for protein sequence comparison has been the PAM-250 matrix. It is argued that for database searches the PAM-120 matrix generally is more appropriate, while for comparing two specific proteins with suspected homology the PAM-200 matrix is indicated.

The signal is comprised of two elements, a heptanucleotide “slip-site” and a downstream tertiary RNA structure in the form of an RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the structure of the pseudoknot and its contribution to the frameshift process by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of pseudoknot mutants. Our results show that the pseudoknot structure closely resembles that which can be predicted from current building rules, although base-pair formation at the region where the two pseudoknot stems are thought to stack co-axially is not a pre-requisite for efficient frameshifting. The stems, however, must be in close proximity to generate a functional structure. In general, the removal of a single base-pair contact in either stem is sufficient to reduce or abolish frameshifting. No primary sequence determinants in the stems or loops appear to be involved in the frameshift process; as long as the overall structure is maintained, frameshifting is highly efficient. Thus, small insertions into the pseudoknot loops and a deletion in loop 2 that reduced its length to the predicted functional minimum did not influence frameshifting. However, a large insertion (467 nucleotides) into loop 2 abolished frameshifting. A simple stem-loop structure with a base-paired stem of the same length and nucleotide composition as the stacked stems of the pseudoknot could not functionally replace the pseudoknot, suggesting that some particular conformational feature of the pseudoknot determines its ability to promote frameshifting.",1991-08-20,"Brierley, Ian; Rolley, Nicola J.; Jenner, Alison J.; Inglis, Stephen C.",Journal of Molecular Biology,,,True,custom_license

We have investigated the kinds of slippery sequence that can function at the IBV frameshift site by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of slippery-sequence mutants. We firstly confirmed that the site of frameshifting in IBV was at the heptanucleotide stretch UUUAAAC, and then used our knowledge of the pseudoknot structure and a suitable reporter gene to prepare an expression construct that allowed both the magnitude and direction of ribosomal frameshifting to be determined for candidate slippery sequences. Our results show that in almost all of the sequences tested, frameshifting is strictly into the −1 reading frame. Monotonous runs of nucleotides, however, gave detectable levels of a −2 +1 frameshift product, and U stretches in particular gave significant levels (2% to 21%). Preliminary evidence suggests that the RNA pseudoknot may play a role in influencing frameshift direction. The spectrum of slip-sequences tested in this analysis included all those known or suspected to be utilized in vivo. Our results indicate that triplets of A, C, G and U are functional when decoded in the ribosomal P-site following slippage ( XXX YYYN) although C triplets were the least effective. In the A-site (XXY YYY N), triplets of C and G were non-functional. The identity of the nucleotide at position 7 of the slippery sequence (XXXYYY N ) was found to be a critical determinant of frameshift efficiency and we show that a hierarchy of frameshifting exists for A-site codons. These observations lead us to suggest that ribosomal frameshifting at a particular site is determined, at least in part, by the strength of the interaction of normal cellular tRNAs with the A-site codon and does not necessarily involve specialized “shifty” tRNAs.",1992-09-20,"Brierley, Ian; Jenner, Alison J.; Inglis, Stephen C.",Journal of Molecular Biology,,,True,custom_license

The agent has been attenuated by serial passage in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. When attenuated virus is inoculated in 8-week-old C3HeJ mice a myelopathy of delayed onset with prominent demyelination of lateral and anterior columns occurs. The DA virus is believed to be related to the Theiler murine encephalomyelitis (TME) viruses because of the similar clinical and pathological conditions which it causes, and because neutralization tests indicate shared antigens between it and GD7, a TME virus. This paper reports electron-microscopic studies of BHK-21 cells infected with DA virus. The cells were prepared 24 and 48 hr after inoculation. Cytopathic effects were observed and infected cells contained plaques consisting of numerous 25 nm virus particles in crystalline array. The virions were exclusively intracytoplasmic and were morphologically indistinguishable from human poliomyelitis virus. These observations appear to establish DA as a picorna virus, related to the TME virus group. The chronic myelopathy caused by DA may prove relevant to chronic demyelinative myelopathies in man, such as multiple sclerosis, and also to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",1977-10-31,"Powell, H.C.; Lehrich, J.R.; Arnason, B.G.",Journal of the Neurological Sciences,,,True,custom_license

Astrocytes contained glial fibrils from one day onwards and often attached their processes to the pial basement membrane. Although the cytoplasmic processes of astrocytes occasionally wrapped axons, they were never shown to form the initial layer of myelin sheaths. However, the tenuous processes of the sub-pial astrocytes were occasionally rolled in myelin lamellae, as if a part of the myelin sheaths was constructed by astrocytic processes.

Protection does not involve the suppression of virus replication in the central nervous system (CNS) or via augmentation of the antiviral antibody response. In the present report we have compared the CNS lesions induced by JHMV in lethally infected and T cell clone protected mice. The presence of virus-specific T cell clones induced a transient increase in mononuclear cell infiltration into the parenchyma of the brains of protected mice, consistent with previous data suggesting that a DTH response was responsible for protection. Immunohistochemical studies suggested further that virus was not replicating in the ependyma or cellular infiltrate, but that the presence of the T cell clone prevented neuronal infection. While the mechanism of effectively altering the in vivo cellular tropism is unknown, survival is accompanied by increased specific destruction of target tissues with fulminant CNS demyelination and an increased incidence of persistent infection.",1989-04-30,"Erlich, Stephanie S.; Matsushima, Glenn K.; Stohlman, Stephen A.",Journal of the Neurological Sciences,,,True,custom_license

This condition does not involve the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterized by a state of hyperactive immunocompetent responsiveness. It develops as the result of an antigenic challenge by a viral protein, either from a viral infection or a vaccination. In order for MS to become a disease affecting the CNS, it is necessary for the blood-brain barrier's (BBB) impermeability to be altered. This is now a fully recognized fact. As a result of this change, the MS lesion, which consists of edema and inflammation occurs. It may but need not lead to demyelination. Several mechanisms can cause this increased permeability of the BBB. The role of the immune system, and in particular of T lymphocytes in initiating and continuing the process of lesion formation remains extremely controversial. In fact, there are unanswered questions regarding the actual target of MS: is it the myelin sheath itself or its forming cell, the oligodendrocyte, or is it the BBB itself leading to bystander demyelination? The role of mild, concussional trauma to the CNS in producing the alteration of the BBB and therefore acting as a trigger or facilitator in the development or enlargement of MS lesions in the CNS, is based on considerable clinical, neuropathological and experimental evidence. Along with another viral infection, it must be one of the commonest causes of progression of MS, and quite often leads to the onset of the clinical manifestations of an hitherto asymptomatic condition.",1993-04-30,"Poser, Charles M.",Journal of the Neurological Sciences,,,True,custom_license

We derive estimates of the number of randomly generated clones required to be reasonably confident of accurately and unambiguously assigning a gene to a particular human chromosome. The collection of clones in such a random panel is contrasted with minimal panels suggested by algebraic coding theory. To approximate minimal panels we suggest the method of simulated annealing for selecting small, informative panels from larger existing collections of clones.

It leads to rearrangements of DNA sequences within genomes. Such genome rearrangements seem to be ubiquitous, since they play a role in evolution, human health and biotechnology. In medicine one important aspect of recombination is its role as one possible step in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. Since recombination may occur as a cellular response to DNA damage, the protection of cells from recombination-inducing agents, so-called recombinagen, should eliminate possible deleterious effects resulting from damage-induced DNA recombination. During the last few years, the awareness of the importance of recombination phenomena has substantially increased and the development of assay systems detecting recombinagens has progressed. The need for considering recombinagenic effects as a safety aspect of chemicals has gained ground in the field of genetic toxicology.

Fifteen subjects were suffering from a common cold on the first week and the other 11 subjects were matched healthy controls. Subjects attended for an initial 3-h testing period that consisted of a set of practice trials and two test sessions involving mood rating and performance of a battery of tests measuring psychomotor functions, attention, and memory. Sessions 3, 4, and 5 took place 1, 2, and 3 weeks later, respectively. In addition to measuring mood and mental performance, symptom severity was rated on a subjective checklist. The results showed that subjects with a cold reported an increase in negative mood and that this was only significant in the first week. Impairments of psychomotor function (simple reaction time and tracking) were also observed at this time. Performance of sustained and selective attention tasks was also impaired in subjects with colds but this effect was only significant in the second week. Other functions such as working and semantic memory were unimpaired in subjects with colds at any point in the experiment. Overall, the present results confirm many of the earlier results obtained in studies of experimentally induced upper respiratory tract illnesses.

Two substrains of Sprague-Dawley rats (A and B) differing in average daily weight gain were used. Female rats of substrain A gained 2 g per day and males gained 7 g. Female rats of substrain B gained 5 g per day and males gained 8 g. Animals were implanted with a stainless steel guide cannula, allowing ICV injections into the lateral ventricle. ICV injections of 1, 5, or 10 μg of oxytocin or isotonic saline in a volume of 5 μl were given. In females, ICV treatment with either saline or 5 μg of oxytocin caused a transient loss of weight within 24 h of treatment. However, in the more slowly growing females of substrain A depression in body weight was observed after a single treatment with saline, whereas the body weight of oxytocin-treated females showed less marked depression and rapidly returned to the pretreatment weight. After a 3-day treatment period an even greater difference in daily weight gain was seen between oxytocin-treated and saline-treated female rats of substrain A. In contrast, no difference in daily weight gain or food intake was observed between oxytocin- and saline-treated male rats of substrain A, nor in females or males of the more rapidly growing substrain B. Intraperitoneal injections of 5 μg of oxytocin did not influence food intake or daily weight gain in female rats of substrain A.

In response to oral vaccination with swinepox virus (SPV), low levels of circulating and intestinal VN antibodies, and higher titres of antibodies reactive in an enzyme immunoassay, including intestinal antibodies of the IgA class, were detected. Oral vaccination with porcine adenovirus type 3 (PAV-3) stimulated both circulating and intestinal VN antibodies, and IgA antibodies were demonstrated in the intestinal contents. It was concluded that SPV and PAV-3 might be suitable vectors for the expression of genes encoding the protective antigens of porcine enteric viruses.",1993-05-31,"Tuboly, T.; Nagy, É.; Derbyshire, J.B.",Research in Veterinary Science,,,True,custom_license

Overall, 57% of patients were seropositive for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1; of these, 50% were classified as World Health Organization Aids stage IV. The prevalence of enteric viruses in stool specimens did not differ significantly between patients with and without HIV infection, and was not associated with acute or chronic diarrhoea, or constitutional symptoms.

To extend the data base on potential health effects from coal liquefaction materials, we performed a study with solvent refined coal (SRC)-II heavy distillate (HD). Fischer-344 rats were exposed for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 5 or 13 weeks to an aerosol of HD (boiling range, 288 to 454°C) at concentrations of 0.69, 0.14, 0.03, or 0.0 mg/liter of air for the high, middle, low, and control groups, respectively. Survival through 13 weeks of exposure was greater than 90% for all groups; body weights for exposed animals were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. significant increases in liver weights and decreases in thymus and ovary weights were observed for treated animals compared with controls. There were also significant treatment-related decreases in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, volume of packed red blood cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and total white blood cells. After 5 weeks of exposure serum cholesterol concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner for both sexes and serum triglyceride amounts decreased for males but not for females. After 13 weeks of exposure, high-dose animals had significant increases in cholesterol (males only), triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen, and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT; males) and significant decreases in albumin, SGPT (females), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Examination of bone-marrow preparations from exposed animals demonstrated consistent decreases in the degree of cellularity, suggesting that this organ is a target for HD. Microscopic evaluation of organ sections indicated exposure-related changes for nasal mucosa, pulmonary macrophages, thymus, liver, kidney, bone marrow, ovaries, and cecum.

Male F-344 rats were exposed to 175 ppm DMA 6 hr per day for 1, 2, 4, or 9 days or 2 years. Gross changes in nasal structure were recorded, effects of DMA on the mucociliary apparatus were assessed using video analysis, and tissues were evaluated for histopathology. In vitro nasal mucociliary flow patterns, mucus flow rates, and ciliary activity were studied and recorded for video motion analysis. There were distinct and generally consistent differences in the shape of the naso-, maxillo-, and ethmoid turbinates between young and old animals. Acute and chronic DMA exposures resulted in erosion of the anterior margins of the naso- and maxillo-turbinates and fenestration of the adjacent septum. Ciliastasis and mucostasis were observed only on the anteromedial aspect of the maxilloturbinate. In the chronically exposed rats, mucociliary activity was present in areas adjacent to erosions of the turbinates and septum. Abnormal mucus flow patterns, including altered or reversed direction of flow and “whirlpool-like” formation, were observed in all treated rats, but were more severe following chronic exposure. There was a good correlation between the distribution of responses as assessed by histopathology and abnormal mucociliary function at all time points. In conclusion, the mucociliary apparatus continues to function in the nasal passages of rats having localized destruction of nasal epithelium, induced by DMA exposure, and this clearance system responds to alterations of nasal structure by modification of mucus flow patterns.",1987-09-30,"Gross, E.A.; Patterson, D.L.; Morgan, K.T.",Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology,,,True,custom_license

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that adaptation is a result of alterations intrinsic to epithelial cells or to the cells and their matrix, and not due to systemic or neural influences. Rats were preexposed to either filtered air (FA) or 0.96 ppm O3 for 8 hr/night for 60 days, and then their tracheae were removed and exposed to 3 ppm O3 in an explant culture system where behavioral, nasal, exudative, and secretory product influences can be eliminated. After exposure to 3 ppm O3 in vitro, quantitative electron microscopic evaluation demonstrated that the epithelia from the FA preexposure group had significantly more necrotic cells and sloughed cells and fewer ciliated cells than the epithelia from the O3 preexposure group. Thus previous exposure to ozone in vivo induces a change in tracheal epithelium which confers resistance to ozone-induced injury in the explant exposure system.",1988-05-31,"Nikula, Kristen J.; Wilson, Dennis W.; Dungworth, Donald L.; Plopper, Charles G.",Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology,,,True,custom_license

Models of rat lung injury, based on acute exposure to 2 ppm ozone for 3 hr and on exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone for 2 days, were used to determine whether EDU pretreatment of rats protected lungs from oxidant injury. Rats were pretreated with 100 mg/kg body wt EDU by ip administration for 2 days prior to and on the days of ozone exposure. No adverse toxicological effects of EDU pretreatment were observed. Lung superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were significantly enhanced from 636 to 882 U/lung and from 599 to 856 U/lung, respectively. One day following acute exposure (2 ppm for 3 hr), an ozone-induced increase of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from 0.01 to 1.18 million cells/lung was decreased to 0.68 million by EDU pretreatment. No alteration occurred in the degree of lung permeability indicated by increased lavage fluid albumin. EDU pretreatment also significantly decreased ozone-induced increases in PMN recovery after 2 days exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone from 5.54 to 2.12 million cells/lung. However, in this second case, EDU pretreatment reduced the observed ozone damage, indicated by a decrease in lavage fluid albumin and by a decrease in the macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration associated with this length of ozone exposure. The observation that EDU-treated cultured pulmonary arterial endothelial cells increased SOD and CAT activities identified a potential lung site of EDU interaction. These data demonstrated that although EDU pretreatment appears not to prevent initial ozone damage, it does reduce the infiltration of PMNs and might therefore prevent amplification of the injury associated with this cell type.",1989-08-31,"Bassett, D.J.P.; Elbon, C.L.; Reichenbaugh, S.S.; Boswell, G.A.; Stevens, T.M.; McGowan, M.C.; Kerr, J.S.",Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology,,,True,custom_license

Membrane segregated cultures were used so that the influences of direct B-T cell contact and T cell factors on B cell differentiation could be independently evaluated. B-T cell contact was not absolutely required for Pb's enhancement of B cell maturation to antibody forming cells (AFCs); however, enhancement of the AFC response by Pb was optimal when B-T cell interactions were allowed. These results were corroborated by use of anti-L3T4 (mouse CD4) to block CD4+ T cell-B cell interaction. Blockade of B-T cell contact with anti-L3T4 did not inhibit the enhancement of the AFC response by Pb. Additional experimentation showed that Pb enhanced the AFC response and Ig production in the presence of antigen-specific T cell help, suggesting that Pb enhances B cell differentiation by augmenting cognate help rather than by inducing a response to Pb-altered-self. In studies employing antigen-specific T cell clones, Pb was found to differentially modulate antigen presentation to TH1 versus TH2 T cell clones, in that TH1 activation was inhibited and TH2 activation was enhanced by Pb.",1991-10-31,"McCabe, Michael J.; Lawrence, David A.",Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology,,,True,custom_license

The daily exposure regimen consisted of a 13-hr background of 0.06 ppm, an exposure peak that rose from 0.06 to 0.25 ppm, and returned to the background level over a 9-hr period, and 2-hr downtime for maintenance. Rats were exposed for 1, 3, 13, and 78 weeks. Additional groups of rats exposed for 13 or 78 weeks were allowed to recover in filtered clean air for 6 or 17 weeks, respectively. Rats exposed to filtered air for the same lengths of time were used as controls. Samples from proximal alveolar regions and terminal bronchioles were obtained by microdissection. Analysis of the proximal alveolar region revealed a biphasic response. Acute tissue reactions after 1 week of exposure included epithelial inflammation, interstitial edema, interstitial cell hypertrophy, and influx of macrophages. These responses subsided after 3 weeks of exposure. Progressive epithelial and interstitial tissue responses developed with prolonged exposure and included epithelial hyperplasia, fibroblast proliferation, and interstitial matrix accumulation. The epithelial responses involved both type I and type II epithelial cells. Alveolar type I cells increased in number, became thicker, and covered a smaller average surface area. These changes persisted throughout the entire exposure and did not change during the recovery pefiod, indicating the sensitivity of these cells to injury. The main response of type II epithelial cells was cell proliferation. The accumulation of interstitial matrix after chronic exposure consisted of deposition of both increased amounts of basement membrane and collagen fibers. Interstitial matrix accumulation underwent partial recovery during follow-up periods in air; however, the thickening of the basement membrane did not resolve. Analysis of terminal bronchioles showed that short-term exposure to O3 caused a loss of ciliated cells and differentiation of preciliated and Clara cells. The bronchiolar cell population stabilized on continued exposure; however, chronic exposure resulted in structural changes, suggesting injury to both ciliated and Clara cells. We conclude that chronic exposure to low levels of O3 causes epithelial inflammation and interstitial fibrosis in the proximal alveolar region and bronchiolar epithelial cell injury.",1992-08-31,"Chang, Ling-Yi; Huang, Ying; Stockstill, Barbara L.; Graham, Judith A.; Grose, Elaine C.; Menache, Margaret G.; Miller, Frederick J.; Costa, Daniel L.; Crapo, James D.",Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology,,,True,custom_license

Purity of the virus was confirmed by electrophoretic, ultracentrifugal, and electron microscopic procedures. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis tests revealed one precipitin line with normal mouse brain, three with purified virus, and four with crude virus when tested against anti-pure virus or anti-crude virus animal serums. The association of a host cell antigen with the virion was confirmed by standard HI and CF tests. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of solubilized purified virus revealed a minimum of six polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 191,000 (No. 1), 104,000 (No. 2), 60,000 (No. 3), 47,000 (No. 4), 30,000 (No. 5), and 15,000 daltons (No. 6). A seventh band was occasionally found in the 165,000-dalton region of the gels. Four polypeptides contained carbohydrate and one contained lipid. Polypeptide No. 5 comprised 26% of the total viral protein and glycopolypeptide No. 3 comprised 23%. Three other components accounted for most of the remaining protein: polypeptide No. 4 (16%), glycopolypeptide No. 6 (14%), and glycolipopolypeptide No. 1 (13%). Glycopolypeptide No. 2 was 8% of the total protein. Bromelin digestion of the viral projections (spikes) removed glycopolypeptides No. 2 and No. 6. Association of the remaining polypeptides with structural components of the virion is only tentatively postulated. The buoyant density in potassium tartrate of the bromelin-treated virus was 1.15 g/cm3 and of the intact OC 43 virion was 1.18 g/cm3. By analytical ultracentrifugation the corrected sedimentation coefficient (s 0 20w) of the OC 43 virion was determined to be 390 ± 16 S, and the apparent molecular weight (MW a ) was calculated to be 112 ± 5 × 106 daltons.",1972-05-31,"Hierholzer, J.C.; Palmer, E.L.; Whitfield, S.G.; Kaye, H.S.; Dowdle, W.R.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Morphologically similar virus particles, approximately 95 nm in diameter, were encountered in all three systems, and a common mode of virus assembly and maturation appeared to obtain. Virus assembly was shown to occur exclusively at internal cytomembrane interfaces, the Golgi complex appearing as the initial assembly site, which site became less focal as infection progressed due to the proliferation of Golgi smooth membranes and the dilation of cisternae and vesicles. The assembly process involved viral budding into cisternal and vesicular lumina, the virion thereby acquiring its limiting membrane. The envelope of such intracellular virions exhibited a poorly defined fringe, approximately 8 nm in width, which appeared to undergo a maturational change as the virions were discharged from the cell, such that, extracellularly, virions displayed a well-developed fringe, approximately 12 nm wide—a change especially noteworthy in the case of virions in infected mouse brain. The presence was noted in infected Vero cells—and in one instance in an infected mosquito cell—of crescent-shaped segments of thickened cisternal membrane, which possibly represented an early phase of viral assembly in which nucleocapsid aligned itself in close apposition to a membrane segment preparatory to the initiation of budding. In areas of the cytoplasm adjacent to sites of viral assembly in neurons, a fine granulofibrillar matrix was frequently found, enmeshed in which were numbers of 50–60 nm spherical structures. In a low proportion of cells from infected mosquito cultures, dense granulofibrillar masses were found in the cytoplasm. In Vero cells, infection with CE virus was cytolytic, while in A. albopictus cells, no gross cytopathic effects were manifest, and persistently infected cultures developed upon subcultivation. However, less than 10% of challenged mosquito cells became productively infected and for a proportion of these, at least as determined by electron microscopy, the infection was lethal.",1973-07-31,"Lyons, Michael J.; Heyduk, Jaroslav",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Growth curves showed maximum virus production at multiplicities of infection of 0.1 and 1; maximum titers of intracellular virus occurred at 22–24 hr and of extracellular virus at 26 hr postadsorption. Tube infectivity titers ranged from 109.0–109.5 TCID50/ml and plaque titers from 1010.2–1010.9 y PFU/ml at the time of peak virus production, when no cytopathology was evident. Virus titer dropped rapidly between 26 and 56 hr, coincident with increasing cytopathology. A single precipitin band was observed in immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis between concentrated virus preparations and antiserum to purified 229E. Neuraminidase and hemagglutinin assays were negative. Virus was purified by two procedures: adsorption to and elution from human “0” erythrocytes and CaHPO4 gel followed by equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation, and PEG precipitation followed by equilibrium glycerol/tartrate gradients and rate zonal sucrose or glycerol/tartrate gradients. Final lots of purified virus containing <0.02% of the crude tissue culture proteins had absorption maxima at 256 nm and minima at 241.2 nm and a mean extinction coefficient of E 1cm 1% = 54.3 at 256 nm.

Unlike tobacco mosaic virus or Rous sarcoma virus RNA, OC-43 RNA prepared by extraction with phenol-SDS or phenol-chloroform degraded into a range of fragments with coefficients of 15–55 S; 4 S RNA was also present as a minor component. This suggests that (a) extensive nicking of a large RNA molecule has occurred during viral growth, due to ribonucleases which are inactivated during phenol extractions; (b) heterogeneity for OC-43 RNA is not due to internal ribonuclease activity and fragments are held together by noncovalent linkages much weaker than those present in the 70 S retroviral RNA complex, or by small proteins; or, most probably, (c) a combination of extensive nicking and weak noncovalent linkages results in the heterogeneous denaturation products.",1977-12-31,"Tannock, Gregory A.; Hierholzer, John C.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

They are readily distinguished on the basis of size, radiolabeling characteristics, and location in relation to the lipid bilayer. The larger glycoprotein is highly labeled by both radiolabeled fucose and glucosamine. This species is found in two forms, GP180 and GP90, with apparent molecular weights of 180,000 and 90,000. GP180 can be converted to GP90 in vitro by treatment of virions with trypsin. Analysis of tryptic digests of GP90 and GP180 give identical peptide patterns. Based on pronase and bromelain sensitivities, GP180/90 is the only protein which is located entirely external to the viral envelope. It appears to comprise the characteristic long, petal-shaped peplomers of the virion. The smaller glycoprotein, GP23, has an apparent molecular weight of 23,000 and is labeled by radiolabeled glucosamine but not by fucose. The level of glucosamine-labeling of GP23 is about 1/10 that of GP180/90. GP23 appears to possess two distinct domains: a smaller, carbohydrate containing region which is found outside the viral envelope, and a larger portion, highly labeled by methionine, which is integrally associated with the viral membrane.

However, another strain of duck influenza virus studied (Hav3 Nav6) was predominantly filamentous, suggesting that the morphology of influenza viruses in their natural hosts varies from strain to strain. After passage in the chick embryo each strain retained the morphological characteristics found in the feces. In contrast to duck influenza viruses, representative human influenza viruses of the HON1, H3N2, and Hswl Nl subtypes replicate only in the upper respiratory tract of ducks. The duck influenza viruses are more stable to low pH than human strains and retain infectivity for over 30 days in nonchlorinated river water at 0° and for 4 days at 22°.

JHMV has a markedly greater neurotropism for weanling BALB/c mice than does A59V. Both viruses display one-hit kinetics when grown in vitro in 17CL-16 cells, a clone of BALB/c3T3 cells. Virus-specific intranuclear, cytoplasmic, and surface antigens have been observed for both viruses by immunofluorescence. The intranuclear antigen appears first at about 2 hr after infection (hpi) followed by the development of the cytoplasmic and surface antigens at 3 hpi at 38.5°. Most, if not all cells that develop the intranuclear antigen, produce cytoplasmic antigen and presumably progeny virus. Progeny virus production is independent of cell fusion and formation of syncytia. Virus-specific ribonucleoprotein is synthesized in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D, a concentration sufficient to inhibit the synthesis of cellular ribonucleoprotein species that have sedimentation properties similar to the virus-specific species. The virus-specific ribonucleoprotein species that is resistant to 10 mM EDTA, presumptive virion ribonucleoprotein, has a sedimentation value in sucrose of about 230 S for JHMV and 200 S for A59V. The species of virus-specific ribonucleoprotein that are sensitive to 10 mM EDTA presumptive messenger ribonucleoprotein, are about 40–100 S in sucrose for both viruses. The purified presumptive virion RNA is about 50 S in sucrose for both viruses. The major species of presumptive mRNA of both viruses is about 18 S with secondary species of about 28 S in sucrose.

This paper describes the neuropathogenesis of JHMV and the isolation and characterization of 34 temperature-sensitive mutants of JHMV. These mutants were selected for their inability to induce syncytia formation after low multiplicity infection (m.o.i. = 0.1 iU) in BALB/c 17CL-1 cells at 38.5° as compared to the induction of syncytia at 33°. N-Methyl-N′-nitrosoguanidine (14 mutants) and 5-fluorouridine (20 mutants) were used as mutagens at a concentration that reduced infectivity by 90–95%. Characterization of these mutants included: induction of syncytia; synthesis of JHMV-specific intracellular RNA; progeny yields at 33, 37, and 38.5°; synthesis of JHMV-specific antigens as determined by indirect immunofluorescence and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; virion thermostability; neuropathogenesis including isolation of virus from infected brain, immunofluorescence of infected brain, and histopathology of brain and spinal cord by light and transmission electron microscopy; ability to protect mice from a lethal JHMV infection; and complementation. RNA-minus ( 17 34 ), RNA-intermediate ( 14 34 ), and RNA-plus ( 3 34 ) groups were defined. One mutant, N3, produces chronic meningitis and demyelination without typical JHMV encephalitis in spite of the fact that neurons are infected as detected by immunofluorescence.

The isolates were unable to complement each other at 32°. Although coinfection between each mutant and parental JHM virus often resulted in decreased yields of both infecting viruses, interference could not be convincingly demonstrated. Both mutants were more thermostable than parental JHM virus and could be distinguished from each other and from parental JHM virus by their thermal inactivation kinetics. The isolates were obtained from single cell clones and therefore presumed to be homogeneous; however, thermal inactivation of one (S-3JHM) indicated the possible existence of a second population. Subclones of virus prepared from each isolate were also found to be thermally stable and to retain the cold sensitive defect. No indication of a second population of S-3JHM virus was detected.",1979-10-30,"Stohlman, Stephen A.; Sakaguchi, Alan Y.; Weiner, Leslie P.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Reducing and/or alkylating reagents did not affect VSV hemagglutination and the impermeable sulfhydryl reagent, dextran-maleimide, did not significantly influence VSV infectivity. These data indicate that glycoprotein spikes are not the major sites for the antiviral activity of sulfhydryl reagents. [14C]Iodoacetic acid was able to penetrate the virion membrane to bind covalently to the free sulfhydryl groups of all five virion proteins, particularly the reduced disulfides of the L protein.

Analysis by hybridization kinetics of the annealing between A59 [32P]cDNA and infected cell RNA from the other four MHV strains demonstrated 70–80% homology. By gel transfer analysis, the A59 [32P]cDNA was able to detect subgenomic-size virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with all of the five MHV strains. A similar pattern of seven viral RNAs was detected in cells infected with A59, MHV-1, MHV-3, and JHM. In contrast, cells infected with MHV-S contained seven virus-specific RNAs, of which only the two smallest species comigrated with RNAs from the other four strains. The results suggest that as previously shown with A59 (S. Cheley, R. Anderson, M. J. Cupples, E. C. M. Lee Chan, and V. L. Morris (1981) Virology, 112, 596–604), all MHV strains tested encode a nested set of subgenomic RNAs. Analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled viral proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that each strain of MHV specified four major viral polypeptides with apparent molecular weights very similar to those previously reported for the E2, N, El, and PEI polypeptides of A59. The strong degree of interstrain homology among the five MHV strains investigated was confirmed by comparative chymotryptic peptide mapping of the viral N proteins. A majority of the chymotryptic peptides from each of the [35Sknethionine-labeled N proteins was found to coelute by high-performance liquid chromotography.

Unlike envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, the transmembrane glycoprotein El is glycosylated normally in the presence of tunicamycin. This suggests that glycosylation of El does not involve transfer of core oligosaccharides from dolichol pyrophosphate intermediates to asparagine residues, but may occur by 0-linked glycosylation of serine or threonine residues. Synthesis of the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 is not readily detectable in the presence of tunicamycin. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation of E2 by tunicamycin either prevents synthesis or facilitates degradation of the protein moiety of E2. Radiolabeling with carbohydrate precursors and borate gel electrophoresis of glycopeptides show that different oligcsaccharide side chains are attached to El and E2. The two coronavirus envelope glycoproteins thus appear to be glycosylated by different mechanisms. In tunicamycin-treated cells, noninfectious virions lacking peplomers are formed at intracytoplasmic membranes and released from the cells. These virions contain normal amounts of nucleocapsid protein and glycosylated El, but lack E2. Thus the transmembrane glycoprotein El is the only viral glycoprotein required for the formation of the viral envelope or for virus maturation and release. The peplomeric glycoprotein E2 appears to be required for attachment to virus receptors on the plasma membrane. The coronavirus envelope envelope glycoprotein E1 appears to be a novel type of viral glycoprotein which is post-translationally glycosylated by a tunicamycin-resistant process that yields oligosaccharide side chains different from those of N-linked glycoproteins. These findings suggest that El may be particularly useful as a model for studying the biosynthesis, glycosylation, and intracellular transport of 0-linked glycoproteins.",1981-12-31,"Holmes, Kathryn V.; Doller, Elizabeth W.; Sturman, Lawrence S.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

While the wild type produced large plaques consisting of fused cells (fusion type) both at 39 and at 32°, the mutant produced small fusion-type plaques at 39°, and at 32°, only after longer incubation, plaques consisting of round dead cells (non-fusion type) were obtained. The mutant grew equally well at both temperatures. Thus, the mutant was cold sensitive in inducing cell fusion, but not in replication or in ultimate cell killing. The cold sensitivity was overcome by the addition of trypsin (0.04 to 0.05%) to the culture medium, but not by treating the virions with trypsin. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the virion proteins failed to detect differences between the wild type and the mutant. In intracellular viral proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-MHV-S rabbit serum, a protein of 68,000 daltons (68K protein) which was present in the wild type-infected cells was absent in the mutant-infected cells, but trypsin treatment or incubation at 39° of the mutant-infected cells failed to induce the 68K protein. After six to seven undiluted passages, the mutant segregated varieties of mutants which were partially or totally reverted to the wild type in phenotype, and also those whose cell fusion induction was absent even at 39°. All these mutants failed to induce the 68K protein in the infected cells. Thus, there was no linkage between the presence of 68K protein and the fusion induction. Trypsin treatment of the infected cells enabled MHV-S to form fusion plaques on otherwise resistant cells, and MHV-2, a producer of non-fusion-type plaques, to form fusion-type plaques.

Immunofluorescence showed that all cells became infected at a multiplicity of 10 PFU/cell. The virus was concentrated and purified to obtain the high titered stocks needed for these one-step growth experiments. Release of virus into the culture medium started 4 hr after infection (pi) and was complete at 10 hr pi. Synthesis of virus-specific RNA, measured by the incorporation of [3H]uridine in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D, also started at 4 hr pi and its maximum rate occurred between 6 and 8 hr pi. RNA labeled during this period was isolated from infected cells. About 50% of this RNA bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose; this material was denatured with glyoxal-dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. Seven RNA species with the following molecular weights were present: 5.6 × 106 (RNA1), 4.0 × 106 (RNA2), 3.0 × 106 (RNA3), 1.4 × 106 (RNA4), 1.2 × 106 (RNA5), 0.9 × 106 (RNA6), and 0.6 × 106 (RNA7). RNA1 comigrated with the viral genome. Artifacts caused by defective interfering particles or breakdown of RNA were excluded. To determine whether these RNA species were functional as messengers in infected cells, virus-specific RNAs present in polyribosomes were analyzed. EDTA treatment was used to discriminate between RNA present in polyribosomes and in EDTA-resistant, presumably ribonucleoprotein, particles. Most (91%) of RNA1 was present in EDTA-resistant particles; the remainder and all other RNAs synthesized between 6 and 8 hr pi were present in polyribosomes. We conclude that MHV-A59 has six subgenomic mRNAs. Since the total molecular mass (11.1 × 106 daltons) of these messengers is about twice that of the viral genome, sequence homologies must exist between the mRNAs.

The replication of three different MHV strains was studied in mouse dissociated spinal cord cultures containing differentiated neurons and nonneuronal cells (NN) (including astrocytes). Cell tropism and maturation of each virus strain was analyzed by immunolabeling methods using antisera to the virion or to purified membrane glycoproteins (E1 and E2) and by electron microscopy (EM). Wt-JHM, which causes acute encephalitis in mice, produces acute cytopathic changes in both neurons and NN cells. In neurons, virions mature in smooth ER cisternae closely associated to the Golgi apparatus. As judged by EM, fewer virions are produced by neurons than NN cells and neurons do not fuse or stain for E2 as do NN cells. NN cells contain large inclusions made of nucleocapsid strands. A temperature-sensitive mutant of JHM, Ts8-JHM, which causes demyelination in mice, infects NN cells but not neurons. Infected NN cells synthesize E1 and E2, and contain large inclusions but few mature virions, even at permissive temperatures. These inclusions appear granular and rarely contain nucleocapsid strands in contrast to wt-JHM infection. NN cells infected with this mutant also display numerous membrane whorls. The hepatotropic strain A59 lacks tropism for neurons and primarily infects NN cells, thus resembling ts8-JHM. Infected NN cells become loaded with intracytoplasmic virions which are secreted from the cells. E1 can only be detected in the perinuclear area of these cells while E2 rapidly spreads throughout the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of A59 infected NN cells frequently contains large tubular structures often in the lumen of the RER. In conclusion, in primary CNS cultures consisting of neurons and NN cells: (1) wt-JHM replicates in both neurons and NN cells but has different effects on these cells; (2) Ts8-JHM exhibits no productive infection of neurons, and in NN cells appears to be defective in assembly and to stimulate membrane synthesis; (3) A59 also shows tropism restricted to NN cells which produce many viruses and display differential distribution of the two virion glycoproteins. Thus, in the absence of the immune system, the MHV strains assayed exhibit differences in viral tropism, cytopathic changes, and viral assembly in CNS cells, and these differences may account for the different disease patterns.",1982-06-30,"Dubois-Dalcq, Monique E.; Doller, Elizabeth W.; Haspel, Martin V.; Holmes, Kathryn V.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Mutants were preselected on the basis of their inability to induce syncytia in infected cells at the restrictive temperature (40°) vs the permissive temperature (31°). Of these mutants, only those with a relative plating efficiency 40° 31° of 3 × 10−3 or smaller were kept. Virus yields at 40° compared to 37° and 31° (leakiness) were determined. Most mutants (16) were RNA−, i.e., unable to synthesize virus-specific RNA at the restrictive temperature. The other four were RNA+. No qualitative differences were detected in the virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with RNA+ ts-mutants, both at 31° and 40°. Virus-specific proteins present in cells infected with is-171 (RNA−) and the RNA+-mutants (ts-43, is-201, is-209, and is-279) were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates. No qualitative differences in the pattern of virus-specific cellular proteins were detected among the mutants except for an additional polypeptide of about 46,000 daltons in ts-209-infected cells. Finally, the neuropathogenic properties of eight of the mutants were investigated. Whereas 102 PFU of wild-type virus injected intracerebrally killed 50 to 100% of 4-week-old Balc/c mice within 1 week, the mutants were highly attenuated. A dose of 105 PFU lead to no or transient disease. However, 4 weeks after infection with ts 342, is-43, or is-201 obvious histological changes were observed in brain and spinal cord of clinically healthy mice.",1983-03-31,"Koolen, Marck J.M.; Osterhaus, Albert D.M.E.; Van Steenis, Gijsbert; Horzinek, Marian C.; van der Zeijst, Bernard A.M.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Persistence in the LM-K cells was not accompanied by production of is mutants or of soluble anti-MHV factors. Infectious center assay demonstrated an approximately 500-fold lower level of infectibility by MHV of the LM-K cells as compared to L-2 cells. On an infected cell basis, production levels of infectious progeny and viral RNA were comparable between the two cell lines. The extent of virus-induced cell-cell fusion, however, was markedly reduced in the LM-K cells. Cell-mixing experiments showed that both infected L-2 and LM-K cells have the capacity of fusing with neighboring uninfected L-2 cells but not with uninfected LM-K cells. This suggests that the decreased level of fusion observed in the LM-K infection is due not to absence of viral fusion protein at the cell surface, but rather to an inherent resistance of the LM-K cell membrane to MHV-induced fusion. It is believed that such fusion resistance in LM-K cells moderates virus dissemination throughout the culture, thereby contributing to a state of virus persistence.",1983-07-30,"Mizzen, Lee; Cheley, Steve; Rao, Meena; Wolf, Robert; Anderson, Robert",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Glycosylation of these proteins was observed to continue to the end of the experiment (28 hr postinoculation). Seven of these intracellular glycoproteins could also be detected in infected Trichoplusia ni TN-368 cells 24 hr postinoculation. When the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin was present (from 0 hr postinoculation) there was no detectable glycosylation of any of these viral-induced glycoproteins. Metabolic labeling of the nonoccluded virus budded from IPLB-21 and TN-368 with tritiated mannose or N-acetylglucosamine identified 11 structural glycoproteins, 8 of which were identical in both virus preparations. All of these structural glycoproteins were sensitive to the inhibitory action of tunicamycin. A single 42K structural glycoprotein was detected (with acetylglucosamine only) in the occluded form of AcNPV. Glycosylation of this structural protein appeared to be insensitive to tunicamycin.

Other permissive cell lines differed according to the treatment period and drug level required for restricting productive infections. The inhibitory effect of indomethacin was progressively reduced if infection of cells was delayed for increasing times after drug removal. Strong inhibition of viral replication also occurred in cells treated with the cyclooxygenase antagonists naproxen, phenylbutazone, and oxyphenylbutazone whereas phenacetin, which does not block cyclooxygenase function, was inactive. Enhanced viral replication occurred in indomethacin-treated HEp-2 cultures when these cells were subsequently exposed to such substances as prostaglandin El, cyclic AMP, or insulin. Conversely, indomethacin-treated cells remained restrictive for VSV if they were subsequently exposed to metabolic inhibitors of functional DNA (actinomycin D or mitomycin C), messenger RNA synthesis (α-amanitin), or protein synthesis (cycloheximide) at concentrations that normally do not compromise viral replication. Pretreatment of HEp-2 cells with mitomycin C markedly shifted the dose response for indomethacin-mediated inhibition of VSV from a 90% inhibitory dose of about 10−4 M to one of 10−9 M or lower. These findings suggest that preexisting host factors essential for replication of VSV, although rendered nonfunctional by the drug indomethacin, can be replenished unless their synthesis is blocked by various classes of metabolic inhibitors.",1984-06-30,"Mukherjee, Pranab K.; Simpson, Robert W.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum anti-JHM virus IgG concentrations present in rats prior to onset of clinical symptoms or during the acute and paralytic phases of disease were compared. High CSF/serum ratios, indicative of local antibody production in the CNS, were noted only where disease was demonstrable suggesting that local antibody production accompanied the infection but did not prevent the neurological disease. Among animals in which neurologic symptoms had not become manifest, only those with elevated CSF/serum ratios were found to have histological CNS lesions. Immunofluorescent microscopy indicated that viral antigens were present in both glia and neurons. Antigen-positive cells were frequently present in histologically normal CNS tissue, while regions of necrosis were antigen negative. Testing for the presence of viral RNA with JHM cDNA probes revealed that the virus was rapidly disseminated throughout the CNS, presumably establishing centers of infection prior to the development of recognizable tissue damage. Viral RNA was also detected in the CNS following recovery from paralysis and as late as 5 months postinfection, where no disease occurred. These findings indicate that, although infection by JHM virus can spread rapidly throughout the CNS, formation of lesions during chronic disease is a slower process. The current data and previous observations suggest that JHM virus can remain in a latent state for periods of at least several months in rats without apparent neurologic disease despite the absence of any known provirus phase in the replicative strategy of coronaviruses.",1984-09-30,"Sorensen, O.; Coulter-Mackie, M.B.; Puchalski, S.; Dales, S.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

The genomic RNA of the virus population (JHM-CC virus) released from different passage levels of the same persistent infection has also been analyzed. The analysis shows the locations within the genomic and intracellular RNAs of more than 45 T1-resistant oligonucleotides and confirm earlier studies (J. L. Leibowitz, K. C. Wilhelmsen, and C. W.

The analysis also identifies in each subgenomic RNA those large T1 oligonucleotides derived from noncontiguous regions of the genome during mRNA synthesis. Two important conclusions can be reached from analysis of the mutant viruses. First, the virus population released from the persistent infection represents a fairly constant mixture of viruses, and the fluctuating emergence of variants as predominant species in the culture does not occur. Second, the data indicate that for particular intracellular RNAs of mutant viruses the sequence rearrangements occurring during subgenomic mRNA synthesis are different from those in the corresponding intracellular RNA of wild-type virus.

Tunicamycin completely inhibited the production of infectious virus particles and significantly reduced the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into viral glycoproteins. In the presence of monensin, reduced amounts of infectious virus particles were produced, which was mainly due to inhibition of virus release, rather than virus production. Monensin only slightly inhibited viral glycoprotein synthesis. The effects of these compounds on infectivity indicated that glycosylation is required for the production of infectious virus, though complete processing of the glycoproteins is not essential. In addition, egress of the virions from infected cells probably requires a functional Golgi complex. In the presence of tunicamycin or monensin various degrees of glycosylation of the major glycoproteins occurred, consequently their rates of migration differed from that of the normal glycoproteins. Tunicamycin completely blocked glycosylation of GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7. In contrast, GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b were partially glycosyaated in the presence of tunicamycin. These results indicated that GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7 are N-linked glycoproteins, but GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b contain both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Tunicamycin blocked the transport of all viral glycoproteins to the cell surface, suggesting that glycosylation is required for this process. In the presence of monensin, the viral glycoproteins were transported and expressed on the cell surface indicating that transport does not require complete processing of the glycoproteins and may occur via a Golgi-independent pathway. In addition, monensin-treated BHV-1 infected cells could act as target cells in an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity assay. Thus, complete glycosylation may not be essential for maintenance of antigenicity and participation in immune destruction.",1985-05-31,"Van Drunen Littel-Van Den Hurk, Sylvia; Babiuki, L.A.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

In contrast to (C3H)MMTV-producing cell lines which expressed MMTV gp52, BALB/cV tumor cells lacked gp52 and expressed instead a 68K, env-related protein. The 68K env protein was also detected on the surface of metabolically labeled BALB/cV tumor cells by an external immunoprecipitation technique. The expression of 68K env was restricted to mammary tissues of BALB/cV mice that also expressed other MMTV proteins. Biochemical analysis established that 68K env was not modified by N-linked glycosylation. 125I-labeled 68K env was rapidly released into the media of tumor cell cultures and was recovered both in the form of a soluble protein and in a 100,000 g pellet. The biologic function of this cell surface-expressed viral protein remains unknown.",1985-05-31,"Slagle, Betty L.; Butel, Janet S.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Immunoprecipitation experiments performed with VZV-infected cells, pulse labeled with [3H]glucosamine in the presence of tunicamycin, suggest that O-linked oligosaccharide is present on the glycoprotein of gp 2. Use of the enzyme endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H revealed that the fully processed form of gp 3 had high-mannose type and that of gp 5 had only complex type of N-linked oligosaccharides. Experiments with monensin suggest that the precursor form (116K) of gp 3 is cleaved during the processing from Golgi apparatus to cell surface membrane.

This presentation deals with specificity of the murine viscerotropic MHV3 and neurotropic JHMV for explanted cells from the CNS of newborn, inbred, Wistar-Furth rats. An unambiguous tropism of MHV3 for astrocytes and JHMV for oligodendrocytes is demonstrated. With the latter cell-virus interaction, relatively small differences in spatial density of oligodendrocytes influence profoundly the duration of persistence and virus yield. The in vitro temporal program of oligodendrocyte differentiation, monitored by induction of a myelin-related enzyme, 2′:3′-cyclic nucleotide-3′-phosphohydrolase, corresponds to that occurring in vivo (F. A. McMorris, J. Neurochem. 41, 506–515, 1983). It is complete within 15–21 days and is coincident with the onset of insusceptibility to disease caused by JHMV. Experimental elevation of intracellular cyclic-AMP levels, presumed to reflect oligodendrocyte differentiation, likewise suppresses JHMV replication without affecting that of MHV3 in astrocytes. On the basis of these data it is concluded that in vitro interaction of JHMV with oligodendrocytes reflects accurately the in vivo host control over the tropism and expression of this virus, thereby effecting the progressive, demyelinative disease, process.",1985-02-28,"Beushausen, S.; Dales, S.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

The viral polypeptides linked originally with disulfide bonds were separated into subunits. The complexes were trimers (P′50) or dimers (P60 and P10). The apparent molecular weights of P81, P53, and P49 changed significantly according to the composition of the lysis buffer used, suggesting that the differences in their molecular weights were due to conformational changes produced by reduction of their intramolecular disulfide bonds. Sulfhydryl-containing polypeptides (P′50-P50, P60, P100, and P33) were detected by N-[14C]ethylmaleimide, and the accessibility of these residues was analyzed after successive stripping of the CIV particle. Radioiodination of external polypeptides by [125I]iodosulfanilic acid shows only one intensively labeled spot corresponding to the P50 polypeptide, whereas P′50 was only slightly labeled.

However, a comparable suppression of the growth of highly virulent MHV-2 was not observed in IFN-treated cells. This differential effect of IFN treatment could also be demonstrated at the level of viral mRNA and viral proteins. In cells infected with MHV-S or MHV-JHM the amount of viral mRNAs was remarkably reduced by IFN treatment. Also the levels of the major intracellular viral proteins, in particular the E, protein, were affected by IFN treatment. Similar effects could not be demonstrated in MHV-2-infected cells. These results suggest that during MHV-S or MHV-JHM infection IFN treatment suppresses virus replication at several stages.

Chemical modifications of the T-ag polypeptide may be important for its multifunctional capacity. T-ag is additionally modified by glycosylation. T-ag was metabolically labeled in SV40-infected cells with tritiated galactose or glucosamine, but not with mannose or fucose. The identity of glycosylated T-ag was established by immunoprecipitation with a variety of T-ag-specific antisera, including monoclonal antibodies. Incorporation of labeled sugar into T-ag was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled sugars, but not in the presence of excess unlabeled amino acids. Labeled monosaccharides could be preferentially removed from T-ag with a mixture of glycosidic enzymes. In addition, galactose was removed from purified T-ag by acid hydrolysis and identified as such by thin-layer chromatography. T-ag oligosaccharides were resistant to treatment with EndoH, and glycosylation was not inhibited by tunicamycin. Together, these data strongly suggest that T-ag is glycosylated. Several characteristics, including lack of mannose labeling, EndoH resistance, and tunicamycin resistance, suggest that T-ag is not an N-linked glycoprotein. Rather, these properties are more consistent with the identification of T-ag as an O-linked glycoprotein.",1985-03-31,"Jarvis, Donald L.; Butel, Janet S.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

This delay was seen in the production of both intracellular and extracellular virus. However, the final titers were similar to those produced by MHV-infected cells maintained in normal medium. The manifestation of virus-induced cell fusion was similarly found to be delayed, but not otherwise decreased in severity, when ammonium chloride was present in the culture medium. Ammonium chloride caused similar delays in production of virus-specific, positive-sense RNAs and of viral polypeptides. The relative proportions and apparent molecular weights of viral RNAs and polypeptides were similar to those found in MHV-infected cells cultured in normal medium. In vitro translation of endogenously produced viral RNAs in cell extracts, prepared from MHV-infected cells, was not inhibited by ammonium chloride. Thus, ammonium chloride has no specific, inhibitory effect on viral protein synthesis. Ammonium chloride did not reduce the number of virus-infected cells in culture, as monitored by infectious center assay. Analysis of early events in MHV infection showed that ammonium chloride did not affect adsorption or internalization of MHV by L-2 cells. However, the subsequent eclipse phase, as monitored by decline in infectivity of internalized virus inoculum proceeded less efficiently in the presence of ammonium chloride. On the basis of the known inhibitory effects of ammonium chloride on lysosomal/endosomal functions, the results suggest an endosomal mechanism of MHV uncoating. Thus the primary effect of ammonium chloride on MHV infection of L-2 cells is to attenuate virus uncoating, thereby chronologically displacing all subsequent virus-encoded functions.",1985-04-30,"Mizzen, Lee; Hilton, Anne; Cheley, Steve; Anderson, Robert",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Effects of the differentiation inducer dbcAMP on levels of the myelin-specific enzyme 2′:3′-cyclic nucleotide-3′-phosphohydrolase (CNPase) activity and virus replication were determined. In the mouse system there was a gradual, continuous elevation of CNPase beyond 30 days whereas in comparable rat cell cultures maximum CNPase enhancement is elicited within 21 days (F. A.

After dbcAMP treatment replication of both coronaviruses was profoundly suppressed in murine oligodendrocytes, consistent with our findings on JHMV replication in treated rat oligodendrocytes. By contrast the replication of JHMV and MHV3 in dbcAMP-treated murine astrocytes was influenced only marginally.

We have isolated and characterized revertants of ts24, a member of the A complementation group of Sindbis HR mutants, that we had demonstrated previously to have a temperature-sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis. These revertants of ts24 replicated efficiently at 40° but nevertheless retained the temperature sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis: they continued to synthesize minus strands late in the replication cycle at 40° but not at 30° and in the presence or absence of protein synthesis. Although failure to regulate the synthesis of minus strands resulted in continuous minus-strand synthesis and in the accumulation of minus strands, the rate of plus-strand synthesis was not increased concertedly. Minus strands synthesized after the rate of plus-strand synthesis had become constant were demonstrated to be utilized as templates for 26 S mRNA synthesis. Thus, the change from an increasing to a constant rate of plus-strand synthesis during the alphavirus replication cycle cannot be governed solely by the number of minus strands that accumulate in infected cells. We present a model for the preferential utilization of minus strands as a mechanism for the cessation of minus-strand synthesis that occurs normally during alphavirus replication.",1986-06-30,"Sawicki, Stanley G.; Sawicki, Dorothea L.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

The 140K protein was antigenically related to N, and upon reduction, yielded only 50K N. Thus, the 140K protein is probably a trimer of N subunits linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. Several cellular RNA-binding proteins were also detected. RNA-binding of N was not nucleotide sequence specific. Single-stranded RNA of MHV, VSV, or cellular origin, a DNA probe of the MHV leader sequence, and double-stranded bovine rotavirus RNA could all bind to N.

Our previous results indicated that the mouse-adapted phenotype maps to the Lansing viral capsid. To further define regions of the capsid that are specifically involved in the infection of mice, antigenic variants resistant to neutralization with monoclonal antibodies were selected, and their mouse neurovirulence was studied. The monoclonal antibodies used were directed against antigenic site 1, an immunodominant loop of capsid polypeptide VP1 located on the virion surface. Ten of twenty-two variants selected had lower intracerebral neurovirulence in mice when compared to the parental virus. Four of the ten antigenic variants with reduced neurovirulence were temperature sensitive (ts) for replication in HeLa cells, while the remaining six variants replicated in HeLa cells as well as the parent virus. Two ts+ variants that were studied had a reduced ability to replicate in the mouse brain. There was no difference in the histopathology and pattern of involvement in the central nervous system of one variant compared to the parent virus. In three variants, reduction of neurovirulence correlated with specific amino acid substitutions at positions 100 and 101 of VP1, located within antigenic site 1. The is phenotype in three variants was associated with a single amino acid deletion at position 105. Virus recovered from the brain of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the antigenic variants was characterized to identify the virus causing disease. In most cases, brain isolates resembled the inoculated virus in neurovirulence and amino acid sequence at the antigenic site. Virus recovered from brains of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the is variants was either ts+ or cold sensitive, and had become more neurovirulent.

In the presence of the glucosidase inhibitor N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin the viral glycoproteins were equipped with oligosaccharides of the composition GIc3Man8,9(GIcNAc)2 and the yield of virus in the extracellular medium was reduced as a result of a block in the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor (pE2) of the E2 viral envelope glycoprotein. The mannosidase I inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) also inhibited the appearance of virus in the medium and the oligosaccharides on the viral glycoproteins had the composition Man9(GIcNAc)2. However, pE2 was cleaved to E2 under these conditions, and it was found that when the yield of virus from the cells and medium together was considered, there was no difference between untreated and dMM-treated cultures, suggesting the presence of intracellular virus particles in the dMM-treated cultures. When examined by electron microscopy, the dMM-treated cultures were found to contain intracellular virus particles. In addition, nucleocapsids were found lining intracellular membranes.

The replication complex was membrane-bound and Mg2+ was essential for RDRP activity. Incorporation was more dependent on exogenous UTP and GTP than ATP or CTP. The specific activity was low, and rate of incorporation of GMP decreased as the period of assay was increased; however, incorporation of label lasted for at least 60 min. RNA products were fractionated by LiCl precipitation, and kinetic studies showed that the sequence of accumulation of label was the same as that observed in vivo, viz., RI → RF → 44 S RNA; limited reinitiation was also observed. This sequence of labeling also indicated that the in vitro RDRP activity was due to an enzyme capable of elongation, release, and reinitiation of Kunjin RNA synthesis and not merely end labeling or elongating preexisting RNA molecules. No labeled bands in urea-polyacrylamide gels were observed using extracts from mock-infected cells and hence the three RNA products of assays were readily identified in a single gel.

The putative protein products predicted from the sequence are a basic 13,000-Da polypeptide and a 9600-Da polypeptide containing an unusually long hydrophobic amino terminus. RNAs transcribed in vitro from DNAs containing each of the open reading frames in pGEM vectors direct the synthesis in vitro of polypeptides of the sizes predicted by the sequence. An RNA transcript containing both of the open reading frames directs the synthesis primarily of the polypeptide corresponding to the downstream open reading frame.

To elucidate the precise mechanism of leader-priming, we cloned and sequenced the 5′-end of the mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA. The 5′-terminal sequences are identical to the leader sequences present at the 5′-end of the subgenomic mRNAs. Two possible hairpin loop structures and an AU-rich region around the 3′-end of the leader sequence may provide the termination site for leader RNA synthesis. The comparison of 5′-end genomic sequences and the intergenic start sites for mRNA transcription revealed that there are homologous regions of 7–18 nucleotides at the putative leader/body junction sites. Some intergenic regions contain a mismatching nucleotide within this homologous region. We propose that free leader RNA binds to the intergenic region due to this homology and is cleaved at the mismatching nucleotide before serving as a primer.

Stohlman, and M. M. C. Lai (1986) J. Virol. 57, 729–737). To better define the mechanism of RNA recombination, we have performed additional crosses involving different sets of MHV strains. Three or possibly four classes of recombinants were isolated. Recombinants in the first class, which are similar to the ones previously reported, contain a single crossover in either gene A or B, which are the 5′-most genes. The second class of recombinants contain double crossovers in gene A. The third class of recombinants have crossovers within the leader sequence located at the 5′-end of the genome. The crossover sites of the third class have been located between 35 and 60 nucleotides from the 5′-end of the leader RNA. One of these recombinants has double crossovers within the short region comprising the leader sequences. Finally, we describe one recombinant which may contain a triple crossover. The presence of so many recombination sites within the 5′-end of the genome of murine coronaviruses confirms that RNA recombination is a frequent event during MHV replication and is consistent with our proposed model of “copy-choice” recombination in which RNA replication occurs in a discontinuous and nonprocessive manner.",1987-02-28,"Keck, James G.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Side, Lisa H.; Makino, Shinji; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

In this paper, we have analyzed the origin, structure, and mechanism of synthesis of these small RNAs. Using cDNA probes specific for leader RNA and genes A, D, and F, we demonstrate that subsets of these small RNAs were derived from the various viral genes. These subsets have discrete and reproducible sizes, varying with the gene from which they are derived. The size of each subset correlates with regions of secondary structure, whose free energy ranges from −1.6 to −77.1 kcal/mol, in each of the mRNAs examined. In addition, identical subsets were detected on the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA, suggesting that they represent functional transcriptional intermediates. The biological significance of these small RNAs is further supported by the detection of leader-containing RNAs of 47, 50, and 57 nucleotides in length, which correspond to the crossover sites in two MHV recombinant viruses. These data, coupled with the high frequency of RNA recombination during MHV infection, suggest that the viral polymerase may pause in or around regions of secondary structure, thereby generating pools of free leader-containing RNA intermediates which can reassociate with the template, acting as primers for the synthesis of full-length or recombinant RNAs. These data suggest that MHV transcription uses a discontinuous and nonprocessive mechanism in which RNA polymerase allows the partial RNA products to be dissociated from the template temporarily during the process of transcription.",1987-02-28,"Baric, Ralph S.; Shieh, Chien-Kou; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Cells infected with the recombinant virus were found to synthesize two polypeptides with molecular weights of 65,000 (G1) and 55,000 (G2) that reacted specifically with antibody against PTV. Studies using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that these proteins accumulated intracellularly in the perinuclear region. The results of endoglycosidase H digestion of these glycoproteins suggested that both G1 and G2 glycoproteins were transported from the RER to the Golgi complex. These proteins were not chased out from the Golgi region during a 6-hr incubation in the presence of cycloheximide. Surface immune precipitation and 125I-protein A binding assays also demonstrated that the majority of the G1 and G2 glycoproteins are retained intracellularly.

Two ORFs were found, encoding polypeptides of 11 K (ORF-1) and 22K (ORF-2). The FIPV sequence was compared to the 3′ end sequence of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). ORF-1 has a homologous counterpart (ORF-X3) in the TGEV genome; both ORFs are located at the same position relative to the nucleocapsid gene. However, as a result of an in-frame insertion or deletion, ORF-1 is 69 nucleotides larger than ORF-X3. A similar event has occurred immediately downstream of ORF1: a 624-nucleotide segment, containing the complete ORF-2, is absent in the TGEV sequence. Most sequence similarity (98.5%) was found in the 3′ noncoding sequences. ORF-X3 and ORF-1 are preceded by the sequence AAC-TAAAC, which is assumed to be the transcription-initiation signal in FIPV and TGEV (P. A. Kapke and D. A. Brian (1986) Virology 151, 41–49). By S1 nuclease analysis, the 5′ end of FIPV RNA 6 was mapped immediately upstream of this sequence. A 700-nucleotide TGEV-specific RNA was found by cross-hybridization with an FIPV 3′ end probe, suggesting that TGEV ORF-X3 is also carried on a separate mRNA.

Two DI-specific RNA species, DIssA of genomic size and DIssE of subgenomic size, were detected in DI-infected cells. Purified DI particles, however, were found to contain predominantly DIssA and only a trace amount of DIssE RNA. Despite its negligible amount, the DIssE RNA in virions appears to serve as the template for the synthesis of DIssE RNA in infected cells. This conclusion was supported by two studies. First, the uv target size for DIssE RNA synthesis is significantly smaller than that for DIssA. Second, when purified DIssE RNA was transfected into cells which had been infected with a helper virus, DIssE RNA could replicate itself and became a predominant RNA species in the infected cells. Thus, DIssE RNA was not synthesized from the genomic RNA of DI particles. By studying the relationship between virus dilution and the amount of intracellular viral RNA synthesis, we have further shown that DIssE RNA synthesis requires a helper function, but it does not utilize the leader sequence of the helper virus. In contrast, DIssA synthesis appears to be helper-independent and can replicate itself.

In order to determine whether T lineage lymphocytes are required for infection, young adult athymic nude (nulnu) mice and euthymic littermates were infected with MTLV and tested for virus shedding. Although euthymic littermates regularly shed virus, in the nude mice only about 20% of isolation attempts up to 100 days postinfection were positive. Blind passage yielded an additional three isolations out of 14 samples (21 %). In addition, unlike many other herpesviruses, the virus did not replicate in a number of epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines that were tested.

In contrast, infection of the LM-K subline leads to virus persistence with reduced cell fusion. We undertook studies designed to elucidate the role of host cell membrane lipid composition and the cytoskeleton in modulating the fusion process and the resultant effect(s) on virus persistence. MHV-induced cell fusion proceeded normally in cells treated with cytoskeleton-disrupting drugs, cytochalasin B and colchicine. Modification of cell membrane fatty acid composition by supplementation of LM-K cells with arachidonic (C-20:4) or palmitic (C-16:0) acids had little effect on the extent of MHV-induced cell fusion or on virus replication. However, supplementation of both cell types with cholesterol (resulting in increased membrane cholesterol/fatty acid ratio) resulted in marked enhancement of virus-mediated cell fusion. The increase in cell membrane cholesterol did not enhance internalization of MHV suggesting that cholesterol primarily modulates a later event. This suggestion was confirmed by demonstrating cholesterol-enhancement of fusion in a contact fusion assay. Cholesterol-supplemented L-2 cells were less productive for virus replication than unsupplemented cells, in agreement with our previous observations that MHV replication is compromised by extensive cytopathic effect. Although cholesterol-supplemented LM-K cells showed increased susceptibility to MHV-mediated cell fusion, the extent of such susceptibility did not approach that observed in L-2 cells. Also, the property of LM-K cells to support MHV persistence was not abolished by cholesterol supplementation. Thus membrane fusion resistance and MHV persistence are modulated but not alleviated by cell membrane cholesterol content.",1988-04-30,"Daya, Maleki; Cervin, Marguerite; Anderson, Robert",Virology,,,False,custom_license

To determine the localization of virus-specific RNA, serial sections of brains from infected and uninfected mice were annealed with a 35S-labeled antisense RNA probe and analyzed by film autoradiography. In the mice with acute encephalomyelitis, viral RNA was present in the mesencephalon, hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, and thalamus. Viral RNA was detected in the spinal cords of all mice with the late onset, demyelinating encephalomyelitis, but was distributed into three different patterns in the brains of these mice, even though all had the same clinical disease. In the first group, viral RNA was detected only in the brainstem. In the second group, viral RNA was detected in the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral grey matter. This distribution was consistent with viral spread along well-defined tracts connecting these parts of the brain. In the third group, viral RNA could be detected both in the brainstem and in several white matter tracts within close physical proximity to the optic chiasm. This distribution was consistent with viral spread by an extracellular route from one white matter tract to other tracts which were physically close, but which were not part of the same pathways. These results suggest that MHV-JHM spreads through the central nervous system both along well-defined neuronal pathways and by spread from contiguous structures, but also suggest that viral replicates preferentially in a limited number of areas of the brain.

Furthermore, treatment of detergent-extracted G protein with endoglycosidase F and endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, enzymes that specifically cleave N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides, respectively, generated a variety of partially unglycosylated species, ranging in molecular weight from approximately 80 to 40 kDa. Virus infectivity was sensitive to limited removal of N-linked or O-linked oligosaccharides by endoglycosidases under conditions which did not greatly alter the molecular weight of the G protein.

It is positioned at the 5′ side of the nucleocapsid (N) gene from which it is separated by an intergenic stretch of 12 bases. The deduced M protein comprises 262 amino acids, has a molecular weight of 29,544, is moderately hydrophobic, and has a net charge of +7 at neutral pH. Thirty-four percent of its amino acid sequence is homologous with the M protein of the bovine coronavirus (BCV), 32% with that of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), and 19% with that of the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV). Judging from alignment with the BCV, MHV, and IBV M proteins, the amino terminus of the TGEV M protein extends 54 amino acids from the virion envelope which compares with only 28 for BCV, 26 for MHV, and 21 for IBV. Eleven of the sixteen amino-terminal amino acids are hydrophobic and the positions of charged amino acids around this sequence suggest that the first 16 amino acids comprise a potentially cleavable signal peptide for membrane insertion. A similar sequence is not found in the M proteins of BCV, MHV, or IBV. When mRNA from infected cells, or RNA prepared by in vitro transcription of the reconstructed M gene, was translated in vitro in the presence of microsomes, the M protein became translocated and glycosylated. When a protein without the amino-terminal signal peptide was made by translating a truncated version of the M gene transcript, some translocation and glycosylation also occurred suggesting that the amino-terminal signal peptide on the TGEV M protein is not an absolute requirement for membrane translocation.

In addition to these internal deletions, various truncated RNAs were detected lacking either partially or completely the 3′ terminal region which is supposed to code for viral replicase. RNA molecules with internal deletions as well as those with 3′ terminal truncations could also be extracted directly from infected cells. During multiple consecutive passages of a given HAV strain, deletions A, B, and C accumulated and a quantitative increase of deleted RNAs occurred.

Specifically the JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) generally causes an acute encephalitis when inoculated is into 2-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In contrast, JHM generally produces a chronic demyelinating disease with resulting posterior paralysis when inoculated is into 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, while JHM readily produces a productive infection in a mouse fibroblast cell line (L-2), it does not form syncytia or replicate well in a tissue cell line of glial origin (G26-24). We have isolated and characterized three MHV-JHM viral variants from the central nervous system of two Wistar Furth rats with a MHV-JHM-induced demyelinating disease. The pattern of viral-specific mRNA for all three of these variants differed from what was observed for the wild-type parental MHV-JHM that had been passaged only in tissue culture. One of these variants, ATIIf cord virus, which induced a chronic demyelinating disease in 2- or 10-day-old intracerebrally inoculated Wistar Furth rats, had a deletion in the coding region of the peplomer glycoprotein mRNA. In addition, this variant formed massive syncytia and replicated well in G26-24 cells. We have not detected this deletion in the other two JHM variants, ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus. ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus primarily produced an acute encephalitis when reinoculated into 2-or 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, these two variants did not form syncytia and had a reduced ability to replicate in G26-24 cells.",1989-03-31,"Morris, Vincent L.; Tieszer, Christina; MacKinnon, Joanne; Percy, Dean",Virology,,,True,custom_license

To further understand the molecular biology of human coronavirus 229E (HCV-229E), molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the viral RNA have been initiated. Following established protocols, the 3′-terminal 1732 nucleotides of the genome were sequenced. A large open reading frame encodes a 389 amino acid protein of 43,366 Da, which is presumably the nucleocapsid protein. The predicted protein is similar in size, chemical properties, and amino acid sequence to the nucleocapsid proteins of other coronaviruses. This is especially evident when the sequence is compared with that of the antigenically related porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), with which a region of 46% amino acid sequence homology was found. Hydropathy profiles revealed the existence of several conserved domains which could have functional significance. An intergenic consensus sequence precedes the 5′-end of the proposed nucleocapsid protein gene. The consensus sequence is present in other coronaviruses and has been proposed as the site of binding of the leader sequence for mRNA transcriptional start. This region was also examined by primer extension analysis of mRNAs, which identified a 60-nucleotide leader sequence. The 3′-noncoding region of the genome contains an 11-nucleotide sequence, which is relatively conserved throughout the Coronavirus family and lends support to the theory that this region is important for the replication of negative-strand RNA.",1989-03-31,"Schreiber, Steven S.; Kamahora, Toshio; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

The 3'-region of this leader sequence contains several repeats of a pentanucleotide (UCUAA), whose number varies among different MHV strains. It has been demonstrated that this UCUAA repeat plays crucial roles in the discontinuous transcription of MHV mRNAs. In the present study, we demonstrate that the number of UCUAA repeats in the leader sequence of MHV genome rapidly decreases during serial passages of viruses on susceptible cells. The downward evolution of the number of UCUAA repeats was not due to a higher growth rate of the viruses with fewer repeats, but seemed to be due to homologous interference between viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeat. The ease with which these variant viruses arose suggests the high frequency of the occurrence of this deletion during RNA replication. This finding is in agreement with the proposed discontinuous and nonprocessive mode of coronavirus RNA synthesis. Analysis of the intracellular subgenomic mRNA species of viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeats and of MHV recombinant viruses suggests that the number of this pentanucleotide repeat at the 3′-end of the leader sequence may regulate the synthesis of certain mRNA species, in agreement with the leader-primed transcription mechanism.",1989-03-31,"Makino, Shinji; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

In addition, sp-4 and JHM-X were distinguished from the other four variants by their inability to bind to monoclonal antibodies recognizing two antigenic domains of the E2 molecule.

All three proteins were released slowly (t 1 2 > 6 hr) from JE-infected monkey cells (Vero cells). Mosquito cell lines released E at a similar rate (t 1 2 > 8 hr), while NS1 and NS1′ were retained in an undegraded form in the cell layer. The proteolytic processing of the three proteins appeared identical in both cell types, but some differences in Winked glycosylation were observed. E, NS1, and NS1′ found within the infected cells of both types contained high-mannose oligosaccharide groups for more than 8 hr after synthesis. Additional sugar residues were added to the single E protein oligosaccharide group prior to release from Vero cells, while sugar residues were trimmed from the E protein oligosaccharide group prior to release from mosquito cells. The forms of NS1 and NS1′ found in the culture fluid of infected Vero cells contained one complex and one high-mannose oligosaccharide. All three glycoproteins released from JE-infected Vero cells were associated with extracellular particles, the virion in the case of E and a low density particle in the case of NS1′ and NSV. Furthermore, E, NS1′ and NS1′ exhibited amphipathic properties in Triton X-114 extraction experiments. Taken together, these results suggest that both the structural (E) and nonstructural NS1′ and NSV) glycoproteins were accumulated within the secretory pathway of the infected Vero cells, assembled into particles, and then released into the extracellular fluid.",1989-04-30,"Mason, Peter W.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

The coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM), causes acute encephalomyelitis and acute and chronic demyelinating diseases and is an important model system for virus-induced neurological disease. Suckling C578L/6 mice infected intranasally with MHV-JHM develop either the acute encephalomyelitis or a late onset, symptomatic demyelinating encephalomyelitis, depending on whether they are nursed by unimmunized or immunized dams. Analysis by in situ hybridization was used to determine the route of entry of MHV-JHM into the CNS in these mice. At early times, viral RNA was detected only in the trigeminal and olfactory nerves and in their immediate connections in all mice. A few days later, MHV-JHM RNA was found throughout the brain in mice dying of the acute encephalomyelitis, but remained confined to the entry sites in mice which did not develop acute disease. These results suggest that MHV-JHM enters the CNS via an interneuronal route in all mice, but that the presence of maternal antibody prevents the dissemination of virus via extracellular fluid. In addition, MHV-JHM may establish low-level persistence in the trigeminal or olfactory nerve or in one of its connections in mice that do not develop acute encephalomyelitis.",1989-06-30,"Perlman, Stanley; Jacobsen, Gary; Afifi, Adel",Virology,,,True,custom_license

The sequence data indicate that segment 1 contains 3302 by and is A+T rich (65.3%). The positive strand of segment 1 contains a single open reading frame that extends 1088 codons and possesses 5′- and 3′-terminal untranslated regions of 18 and 20 bp, respectively. The first AUG conforms to the Kozak consensus sequence and if utilized, would yield a protein having a calculated molecular weight of 124–847, very close to the apparent molecular weight of VP1 (M.W. 125,000). The deduced amino acid sequence presents significant similarities with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of several RNA viruses. VP1 was also synthesized in baculovirus using two transfer vecors: pAC461 and pVL941. Following infection of Sf9 cells with a recombinant baculovirus, a full-length nonfusion protein was synthesised which shares properties with authentic VP1 made in monkey kidney cells. The level of VP1 synthesis was about 10-fold higher when the baculovirus recombinant was derived from the pVL941 transfer vector. In that case, VP1 was expressed in yields approximately equivalent to 10% of the cellular protein. The recombinant protein was immunoprecipitated by hyperimmune serum raised against purified rotavirus.

In this study, the biosynthetic pathway and possible biological activities of this protein were examined. The glycosylation of gp65 in virus-infected cells was inhibited by tunicamycin but not by monensin, suggesting that it contains an N-glycosidic linkage. Glycosylation is cotranslational and appears to be complete before the glycoprotein reaches the Golgi complex. Pulse-chase experiments showed that this protein decreased in size after 30 min of chase, suggesting that the carbohydrate chains of gp65 undergo trimming during its transport across the Golgi. This interpretation is supported by the endoglycosidase treatment of gp65, which showed that the peptide backbone of gp65 did not decrease in size after pulse-chase periods. This maturation pathway is distinct from that of the E1 or E2 glycoproteins. Partial endoglycosidase treatment indicated that gp65 contains 9 to 10 carbohydrate side chains; thus, almost all of the potential glycosylation sites of gp65 were glycosylated. In vitro translation studies coupled with protease digestion suggest that gp65 is an integral membrane protein.

The quantity of the individual MV mRNA species was quite different in comparison to lytically infected Vero cells. A steep gradient of MV transcripts was found in brain tissue which is most likely due to strongly attenuated transcription of mRNAs along the viral genome, representing particularly low transcription of the glycoprotein genes. In addition, in vitro translation assays only revealed synthesis of N and P protein in consistent fashion.

At the nucleotide level, the N gene sequences of these viral strains, and that of MHV-JHM, were more than 92% conserved overall. Even higher nucleotide sequence identity was found in the 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) of the five strains, which may reflect the role of the 3′ UTR in negative-strand RNA synthesis. All five N genes were found to encode markedly basic proteins of 454 or 455 residues having at least 94% sequence identity in pairwise comparisons. However, amino acid sequence divergences were found to be clustered in two short segments of N, putative spacer regions that, together, constituted only 11% of the molecule. Thus, the data suggest that the MHV N protein is composed of three highly conserved structural domains connected to each other by regions that have much less constraint on their amino acid sequences. The first two conserved domains contain most of the excess of basic amino acid residues; by contrast, the carboxy-terminal domain is acidic.

Eighteen potential N-glycosylation sites, two heptad repeat domains, and a possible “trypsin-like” cleavage site were identified. The mature P protein consists of two subunits and their electrophoretic mobility upon endoglycosidase F treatment strongly suggests that the predicted cleavage site is functional in vivo. The heptad repeat domains are probably involved in the generation of an intra-chain coiled-coil secondary structure; similar inter-chain interactions can play a role in P protein oligomerization.

Indirect immunofluoresence revealed that the majority of RV antigen in transfected and infected COS cells was localized to the Golgi region, including the capsid protein. Accumulation of capsid protein in the juxtanuclear region was determined to be RV glycoprotein dependent. Unlike alphaviruses, RV El did not require E2 for targeting to the Golgi where it was retained. E2 was however necessary for cell surface expression of Et.

For a wide variety of viruses, including murine hepatitis virus (a coronavirus), vesicular stomatitis virus (a rhabdovirus), and two paramyxoviruses (Sendai virus and SV5), susceptibility to virus-induced fusion was found to be inversely correlated with susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion. This phenomenon was observed both for cell fusion occurring in the course of viral infection and for fusion induced “from without” by the addition of high titers of noninfectious or inactivated virus. The fusion-altered cell lines (fusible by virus but not by PEG) are characterized by their unusual lipid composition, including marked elevation of saturated fatty acids and the presence of an unusual ether-linked neutral lipid. To test the association between lipid composition and fusion, acyl chain saturation was manipulated by supplementing the culture medium with exogenous fatty acids. In such experiments, it was possible to control the responses of these cells to both viral and chemical fusogens. Increasing the cellular content of saturated fatty acyl chains increased the susceptibility of cells to viral fusion and decreased susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion, whereas lowering fatty acid saturation had the opposite effect. Thus, parallel cultures of cells can be either driven toward the PEG-fusible/virus-fusion-resistant phenotype of the parental cells or rendered susceptible to viral fusion but resistant to PEG-induced fusion, solely by the alteration of cellular lipids.

To determine the pathway by which virus reaches the cord, brains and spinal cords of infected, asymptomatic mice were analyzed by in situ hybridization. Viral RNA was always detected in the anterior part of the upper spinal cord. A similar analysis of mice with the recent onset of hindlimb weakness showed that viral RNA was detected in the same location. The results suggest that MHV is transported to the spinal cord via well-defined neuroanatomic pathways and that viral amplification with resultant clinical disease occurs from this site of persistence in the anterior spinal cord. This process of viral amplification may involve the generation of viral variants as has been described for MHV-infected rats. No major changes in viral RNA or protein could be detected when MHV isolated from mice with hindlimb paralysis was analyzed.

Moreover, in the presence of tunicamycin which inhibits en bloc addition of these mannose-rich side chains, virus budding was substantially decreased and infectious virions were reduced by more than 1000-fold in the supernatant medium. Incubation in the presence of castantospermine, which permits addition of oligomannosyl-rich chains but blocks further processing, restored transport and cleavage of GP-C and maturation of virions.

The RUB genomic RNA contains two long open reading frames (ORFs), a 5′-proximal ORF of 6656 nucleotides and a 3′-proximal ORF of 3189 nucleotides which encodes the structural proteins. Thus, the genomic organization of RUB is similar to that of alphaviruses, the other genus of the Togavirus family, and the 5′-proximal ORF of RUB therefore putatively codes for the nonstructural proteins. Sequences homologous to three regions of nucleotide sequence highly conserved among alphaviruses (a stem-and-loop structure at the 5′ end of the genome, a 51-nucleotide conserved sequence near the 5′ end of the genome, and a 20-nucleotide conserved sequence at the subgenomic RNA start site) were found in the RUB genomic RNA.

Mechanisms of TGEV neutralization by MAbs were characterized at high, intermediate, and low antibody-to-virus ratios. Under these conditions, mainly three steps of the replication cycle were inhibited: binding of virus to the cell, internalization, and a step that takes place after internalization. In addition, virus aggregation could be responsible for the neutralization of 10 to 20% of virus infectivity.",1990-08-31,"Suñé, Carlos; Jiménez, Gustavo; Correa, Isabel; Bullido, María J.; Gebauer, Fatima; Smerdou, Cristian; Enjuanes, Luis",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Complementation analysis revealed the presence of one RNA+ and five RNA− complementation groups. None of the RNA− complementation groups transcribed detectable levels of positive- or negative-stranded RNA at the restrictive temperature. Temperature shift experiments after the onset of mRNA synthesis revealed at least two classes of RNA− mutants. RNA− complementation groups A, B, D, and E were blocked in the ability to release infectious virus and transcribe mRNA and genome, while group C mutants continued to release infectious virus and transcribe both mRNA and genome. Temperature shift experiments at different times postinfection suggest that the group C mutants encode a function required early in viral transcription which affects the overall rate of positive strand synthesis. Analysis of steady state levels of negative strand RNA after the shift indicate that the group C mutants were probably blocked in the ability to synthesize additional minus strand RNA under conditions in which the group E mutants continued low levels of minus strand synthesis. These data suggest that at least four cistrons may be required for positive strand synthesis while the group C cistron functions during minus strand synthesis.",1990-08-31,"Schaad, Mary C.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Egbert, James; Lum, Karen; Fu, Kaisong; Wei, Theodore; Baric, Ralph S.",Virology,,,False,custom_license

Maximum recombination frequencies occurred under multiplicities of infection greater than 10 each in which 99.99% of the cells were co-infected. Recombination frequencies between different is mutants increased steadily during infection and peaked late in the virus growth cycle. These data suggest that recombination is a late event in the virus replication cycle. Recombination frequencies were also found to range from 63 to 20,000 times higher than the sum of the spontaneous reversion frequencies of each is mutant used in the cross. Utilizing standard genetic recombination techniques, the five RNA− complementation groups of MHV-A59 were arranged into an additive, linear, genetic map located at the 5′ end of the genome in the 23-kb polymerase region. These data indicate that at least five distinct functions are encoded in the MHV polymerase region which function in virus transcription. Moreover, using well-characterized is mutants the recombination frequency for the entire 32-kb MHV genome was found to approach 25% or more. This is the highest recombination frequency described for a nonsegmented, linear, plus-polarity RNA virus.",1990-08-31,"Baric, Ralph S.; Fu, Kaisong; Schaad, Mary C.; Stohlman, Stephen A.",Virology,,,False,custom_license

A 3′ noncoding region of 80 nucleotides followed by two complete open reading frames (ORFs) were found within this sequence. The two ORFs were in different reading frames and overlapped each other by 11 nucleotides. One ORF encoded a protein of 170 amino acids and the other ORF, located adjacent to the 3′ noncoding region of the viral genome, encoded a 114 amino acid protein. Thirty-three N-terminal residues were sequenced directly from purified LDV capsid protein, Vpi, and this amino acid sequence mapped to the ORF adjacent to the 3′ noncoding region.

Treatment of mouse L-2 fibroblasts with ammonium chloride, chloroquine, or dansylcadaverine inhibited infection of MHV to a much lesser degree than that of VSV, suggesting a relatively minor role for the endocytic pathway and functional endosomes in MHV infection. Endocytosis of MHV and VSV into L-2 cells was assayed by the recovery of infectious (i.e., not uncoated) viruses from homogenates of cells harvested within the first few minutes of infection (and treated with protease to remove surface-bound virus). The results thus suggest that while a small proportion of the MHV inoculum is internalized by endocytosis, productive infection does not depend on functional endocytosis as utilized by VSV. Studies on direct virion-mediated cell fusion showed that MHV can induce fusion at pH 7.4, whereas VSV causes fusion at pH 5.0. Taken together, the above results suggest that MHV enters L-2 cells predominantly by membrane fusion with a non-acidified compartment such as the plasma membrane, endocytic vesicles, or endosomes (prior to their acidification). Results obtained from cell lines which differed in permissiveness to MHV infection suggested that the ability to support MHV infection does not correlate with endocytosis. Rather, nonpermissive cells, such as rat astrocytoma (C-6) and Vero cells, showed higher levels of recoverable internalized MHV than did fully permissive L-2 cells. Cells which are normally nonpermissive to MHV, could be rendered MHV-susceptible by PEG-induced fusion of cell surface-bound virus. Such PEG-mediated susceptibility to MHV infection was insensitive to inhibition by ammonium chloride, supporting the idea that host cell restriction of MHV infection in C-6 and Vero cells may be due to a block in nonendosomal membrane fusion. Thus endocytic internalization of MHV, which clearly occurs in a variety of cells, does not guarantee productive infection.",1991-01-31,"Kooi, Cora; Cervin, Marguerite; Anderson, Robert",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Virus grown in these cells was used to isolate and purify the HE-protein. This protein has been shown recently to have acetylesterase activity and to function as the receptor-destroying enzyme of BCV. Here we show that HEV contains this enzyme, too. The glycoproteins were solubilized by treatment of virions with octylglucoside. Following centrifugation through a sucrose gradient the surface proteins S and HE (hemagglutinin-esterase) were obtained in purified form. After removal of the detergent by dialysis, HE formed rosettes as shown by electron microscopy. The purified HE protein retained acetylesterase activity and was able to function as a receptor-destroying enzyme rendering red blood cells resistant against agglutination by both coronaviruses. HE protein released from the viral membrane failed to agglutinate red blood cells. However, it was found to recognize glycoconjugates containing N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid as indicated by a binding assay with rat serum proteins blotted to nitrocellulose and by its ability to inhibit the hemagglutinating activity of BCV, HEV, and influenza C virus.

Extensive syncytia formation was observed in cells infected with the S2 recombinant but not with the HE or S1 recombinant baculoviruses. Fusion of Sf9 cells expressing the intact S protein precursor was evident after trypsin treatment.

In addition, their genome organization and expression strategy, which involves the synthesis of a 3′-coterminal nested set of mRNAs, are comparable. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the genome of the torovirus prototype, Berne virus (BEV), has now revealed the results of two independent nonhomologous RNA recombinations during torovirus evolution. Berne virus open reading frame (ORF) 4 encodes a protein with significant sequence similarity (30–35% identical residues) to a part of the hemagglutinin esterase proteins of corona-viruses and influenza virus C. The sequence of the C-terminal part of the predicted BEV polymerase ORF1a product contains 31–36% identical amino acids when compared with the sequence of a nonstructural 30 32K corona-virus protein.

We have determined the complete sequence of this gene of the JHM strain by cDNA cloning and sequencing. The total length of this gene is 21,798 nucleotides long, which includes two overlapping, large open reading frames. The first open reading frame, ORF 1 a, is 4488 amino acids long. The second open reading frame, ORF 1 b, overlaps ORF 1 a for 75 nucleotides, and is 2731 amino acids long. The overlapping region may fold into a pseudoknot RNA structure, similar to the corresponding region of the RNA of avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The in vitro transcription and translation studies of this region indicated that these two ORFs were most likely translated into one polyprotein by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Thus, the predicted molecular weight of the gene 1 product is more than 800,000 Da. The sequence of ORF 1 b is very similar to the corresponding ORF of IBV. In contrast, the ORF 1 a of these two viruses differ in size and have a high degree of divergence. The amino acid sequence analysis suggested that ORF 1 a contains several functional domains, including two hydrophobic, membrane-anchoring domains, and three cysteine-rich domains. It also contains a picornaviral 3C-like protease domain and two papain-like protease domains. The presence of these protease domains suggests that the polyprotein is most likely processed into multiple protein products. In contrast, the ORF 1b contains polymerase, helicase, and zinc-finger motifs. These sequence studies suggested that the MHV gene 1 product is involved in RNA synthesis, and that this product is processed autoproteolytically after translation.

In order to characterize the structure of these antigenic sites, we constructed a series of cDNA clones encoding deleted or truncated S1 derivatives and expressed the modified genes in insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses. Monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes A and B recognized only the mutant S1 polypeptides containing amino acids 324–720, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol. In addition, two domains within this region were identified and only mutants containing both domains were immunoreactive, indicating that both were critical in the formation of the antigenic determinants. One domain was localized between residues 324 and 403 and the other at residues 517–720. Deletion of either domain inhibited extracellular secretion of the mutant proteins whereas mutants containing both or none of the domains were secreted efficiently. This observation suggests a vital function of the native conformation of the S1 protein in both antigenic structure and intracellular transport. Antigenic determinants A and B were not distinguished, but these determinants appeared to require both domains for epitope formation. Our results suggest that the antigenic determinants formed by two domains are likely associated with the probable polymorphic region of the BCV S1 subunit.",1991-07-31,"Yoo, Dongwan; Parker, Michael D.; Song, Jaeyoung; Cov, Graham J.; Deregt, Dirk; Babiuk, Lorne A.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Site A is the main inducer of neutralizing antibodies and has been previously subdivided into the three subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac. The residues that contribute to these sites were localized by sequence analysis of 21 mutants that escaped neutralization or binding by TGEV-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), and by epitope scanning (PEPSCAN). Site A contains the residues 538, 591, and 543, which are essential in the formation of subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac, respectively. In addition, mar mutant 1B.H6 with residue 586 changed had partially altered both subsite Aa and Ab, indicating that these subsites overlap in residue 586; i.e. this residue also is part of site A. The peptide 537-MKSGYGQPIA-547 represents, at least partially, subsite Ac which is highly conserved among coronaviruses. This site is relevant for diagnosis and could be of interest for protection. Other residues contribute to site B (residues 97 and 144), site C (residues 50 and 51), and site D (residue 385). The location of site D is in agreement with PEPSCAN results. Site C can be represented by the peptide 48-P-P/S-N-S-D/E-52 but is not exposed on the surface of native virus. Its accessibility can be modulated by treatment at pH >11 (at 4°) and temperatures >45°.

This infection is specific to chains of functionally related neurons but at the death of the animal some nuclei remain uninfected. CVS also penetrated the trigeminal system. The avirulent mutant AvOl, carrying a mutation in position 333 of the glycoprotein, infected the olfactory epithelium and the trigeminal nerve as efficiently as CVS. During the second cycle of infection, the mutant was able to infect efficiently periglomerular cells in the MOB and neurons of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, which indicates that maturation of infective particles is not affected in primarily infected neuronal cells. On the other hand, other neuronal cells permissive for CVS, such as mitral cells or the anterior olfactory nucleus, are completely free of infection with the mutant, indicating that restriction is related to the ability of AvO1 to penetrate several categories of neurons.

However, although a protein product has been identified from the 3c open reading frame, to date the coding function of 3a and 3b has not been established. We present nucleotide sequence data suggesting that each of the three open reading frames is conserved in a variety of different IBV strains and further show, through the preparation of monospecific antisera against bacterial fusion proteins, that IBV-infected cells contain small amounts of the products of these ORFs. In vitro translation studies using synthetic mRNAs containing the 3a, 3b, and 3c open reading frames suggest strongly that all three proteins can be translated from a single molecular species, and expression studies carried out in intact cells support this conclusion. Thus mRNA3 of IBV appears to be functionally tricistronic.",1991-10-31,"Liu, D.X.; Cavanagh, D.; Green, P.; Inglis, S.C.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

After isolation from liver tissue viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs were found to be resistant to RNase degradation. This protection was due to RNA packaging into particles. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of liver homogenates allowed separation of such particles containing either genomic RNA or subgenomic RNA. Genomic and subgenomic RNAs are protein-linked and for the genomic molecule this interaction is localized within the first 179 nucleotides.

Symptom attenuation leading to persistent infections was closely correlated with the passage in which DIs first developed. Comparisons of nucleotide sequences of 10 cDNA clones from 2 DI RNA populations and with a previously characterized TBSV DI RNA revealed the same four regions of sequence from the TBSV genome were strictly conserved in each of the DI RNAs: the virus 5′ leader sequence of 168 bases; a region of approximately 200–250 bases from the viral polymerase gene; approximately 70 bases from the 3′ terminus of the viral pl9 and p22 genes; and approximately 130 bases from the 3′terminal noncoding region.

Immunization with neither recombinant induced early death after challenge with FIPV, strongly suggesting that antibody-dependent enhancement is mediated by antibodies against S only.

These sequences were compared with recently published sequences of the HE genes of the Quebec and Mebus strains. A large open reading frame of 1272 nt encoding a protein of 424 amino acid residues was predicted. The putative esterase active site was conserved in the virulent and avirulent BCV strains, indicating that this domain is probably not a determinant for BCV virulence.

Monoclonal antibodies specific for the HE glycoprotein inhibited the hemagglutination and acetylesterase activities of BCV-L9, but showed no inhibitory effect on the acetylesterase activity of BCV-LY138. These results suggest that at least one epitope is located proximal to one of the three strain-specific amino acids.

The disposition of the E protein in the membrane was studied by in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes and by subsequent proteinase K digestion. Only small portions of either end of the polypeptide were found to be exposed on opposite sides of the vesicle membranes. Experiments with a hybrid E protein (EM) containing the C-terminal tail of a coronavirus M protein, to which an anti-peptide serum was available, showed that this C-terminus was present at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which is another similarity to the coronavirus M protein.

Both variants have a large deletion of 246 amino acids in the carboxy-terminal end of the HE protein. However, this truncated protein was not detected in the infected cells, suggesting either a translational regulation or rapid degradation of the truncated protein in these cells. The variant virus isolated from the spinal cord has a second deletion of 147 amino acids in the amino-terminal half of the S protein. This deletion site corresponds to a hypervariable region where deletions have been frequently noted among MHV variants with different biological properties.

A polypeptide (161 amino acids) containing the N-terminal heptad repeat region synthesized in vitro was capable of forming stable dimers and trimers. Using various criteria, we demonstrated that the stability of the intact σ1 oligomer is conferred mainly by the N-terminal heptad repeat region.

The G cistron is 2045 nucleotides (nt) long and the G protein mRNA open reading frame (ORF), as determined from the cDNA sequence, contains 1896 nt and encodes a protein of 632 amino acids. Immunoblots with antibodies elicited against the purified glycoprotein from virus particles reacted with a fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli, indicating that the cloned ORF encodes the G protein. The 5′ end of the G protein mRNA corresponds to nt 5111, relative to the 3′ end of the viral (minus sense) genome, as determined by primer extension from mRNA isolated from infected plants, and extends to nt position 7155 on the genomic RNA. A 34-nt untranslated 5′ leader sequence and a 115-nt untranslated 3′ end flank the ORF on the mRNA. The gene junctions on either side of the G gene on the genomic RNA are identical to those previously described for other SYNV genes and are similar to sequences separating genes of animal rhabdoviruses. The predicted molecular weight of the G protein is 70,215 Da, a value less than the 77,000 Da estimated for the glycosylated G protein from virus particles. The deduced amino acid sequence of the SYNV G protein shares little direct relatedness with the G proteins of other rhabdoviruses, but appears to contain a similar signal sequence, a transmembrane anchor domain, and glycosylation signals.

The virus consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb, with a polyadenylated 3' end. We now report on the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of an overlapping, contiguous set of cDNA clones representing the entire genome of the HEV Burma strain [HEV(B)]. The largest open reading frame extends approximately 5 kb from the Fend and contains the RNA-directed RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. The second major open reading frame (ORF2) begins 37 by downstream of the first and extends approximately 2 kb to the termination codon present 65 by from the 3' terminal stretch of poly(A) residues. ORF2 contains a consensus signal peptide sequence at its amino terminus and a capsid-like region with a high content of basic amino acids similar to that seen with other virus capsid proteins. A third open reading frame partially overlaps the first and second and encompasses only 369 bp. In addition to the 7.5-kb full-length genomic transcript, two subgenomic polyadenylated messages of approximately 3.7 and 2.0 kb were detected in infected liver using a probe from the 3' third of the genome. The genomic organization of the virus is consistent with the Fend encoding nonstructural and the 3' end encoding the viral structural gene(s). The expression strategy of the virus involves the use of three different open reading frames and at least three different transcripts. HEV was previously determined to be a nonenveloped particle with a diameter of 27–34 nm.

In this paper we report the development of a recombination assay for coronavirus, using polymerase chain reaction, in the absence of selection pressure. Our results showed that within a 1-kb region of the peplomer gene, RNA recombination occurred at almost every potential crossover site. Thus, coronavirus RNA recombination appears to be more random than previously realized. However, after serial passages of the recombinant viruses in tissue culture, the recombination sites among the progeny viruses became clustered in the region which contains the previously reported “hot spot” for coronavirus recombination. These results suggest that RNA recombination is common and random in nature, but only certain recombinants can be selected. Thus, the presence of recombinational “hot spots” for coronavirus or other RNA viruses most likely resulted from selection of certain recombinant viruses and not restriction on the occurrence of RNA recombination. The failure to detect recombinants in other RNA viruses may therefore be due to unfavorable properties of recombinant viruses. This approach can be used to detect recombinants in these viruses.",1991-11-30,"Banner, Lisa R.; Mc Lai, Michael",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Full-length (protein product designated A) and C-terminal truncated (protein product designated B) serotype 3 reovirus Sl mRNA transcripts synthesizedin vitro were cotranslated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the products were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under conditions which allowed for the identification of oligomeric forms of σl. A total of four oligomeric protein bands (corresponding to A3, A2B1, A1B2, and B3, respectively) was consistently observed, which suggests that the protein is made up of three monomeric subunits. Biophysical characterization of purified σ1 using column filtration and sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis confirmed the highly asymmetric shape of σ1 and allowed us to determine the molecular weight of the native protein to be ∼132K (a trimer). Similar biophysical analysis on the two tryptic fragments of the σ1 [N-terminal fibrous tail (26K monomeric molecular weight) and the C-terminal globular head (23K monomeric molecular weight)] yielded molecular weights of 77K and 64K, respectively, both again corresponding to trimers. We therefore conclude that protein σ1 is a homotrimer and provide, with supportive experimental evidence, a rationale for the anomalous behavior of the oligomeric protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which, coupled with chemical cross-linking studies, has in part led to the previous suggestion that σ1 might be a higher order oligomer.",1991-09-30,"Strong, James E.; Leone, Gustavo; Duncan, Roy; Sharma, Rajendra K.; Lee, Patrick W.K.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

The sequences are 2784 and 2630 by long, respectively, and contain a single large open reading frame encoding the VP1 protein, the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of IPNV. The proteins exhibit an 88% homology with each other, but only 41% with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) VP1, another member of the Birnaviridae. Despite the low overall homology between the IPNV and IBDV VP1 proteins, homologous regions were detected within the central portion of the proteins. The carboxy-proximal regions of the VP1, which contain very low amino acid homology, displayed evidence of conservation in structural features such as a hydrophilic, highly basic domain. Consensus sequences associated with GTP-binding proteins and RdRps were also detected in VP1. However, unlike the RdRps associated with single-stranded plus RNA viruses, the birnavirus RdRp lacks the Gly-Asp-Asp motif characteristic of this enzyme family.",1991-04-30,"Duncan, Roy; Mason, Carla L.; Nagy, Eva; Leong, Jo-Ann; Dobos, Peter",Virology,,,False,custom_license

Among surface expressed polypeptides is the 35-kDa antigen, previously designated Ag35. Both monoclonal (mAb) and monospecific affinity pure antibodies directed against Ag35 neutralized vaccinia infectiousness, indicating that this prominent surface antigen has a function during early virus-host cell interactions. The binding of several monoclonal antibodies to various regions of Ag35 was tested by reacting CNBr fragments, derived from the polypeptide, employing Western blotting. All mAbs tested reacted with the same region of Ag35. Estimation of the molecular weights (MW), based on migration of the CNBr peptides in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that those partial digestion products which contained a proline-rich 99 amino acid limit digest fragment were present at a position approximately 12.5 kDa larger than that predicted from the DNA sequence. By contrast, partial and limit digest products lacking the proline-rich fragment migrated to the MW position expected from the length of the DNA sequence. This observation demonstrates that departure from a predicted 22.3 kDa to an anomalous MW of Ag35 is conferred by the proline-rich peptide. The surface location of Ag35 was confirmed by immune electron microscopy. In a competition test the binding specificity of mAb and affinity-purified antibodies at the surface of virions could be demonstrated. Evidence for an association of Ag35 with the virus envelope at various stages during biogenesis of vaccinia was obtained by immune electron microscopy of whole mounts and thin sections. Presence of Ag35 as an early component of immature and mature virions, probably residing in the bilayer membrane structure was detected. A distinction can, therefore, be made between Ag35 and several other vaccinia envelope polypeptides which are synthesized as late functions and added during late stages of envelope assembly.",1991-04-30,"Gordon, James; Mohandas, Anjani; Wilton, Sharon; Dales, Samuel",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Some features of these RNAs suggest that they are similar to defective interfering (DI) RNAs, and would be the first to be reported for the potexvirus group. The prototype 1.2-kb RNA is 1172 nucleotides in length excluding a probable poly(A) tail and is composed of two noncontiguous regions corresponding to 757 nucleotides of the 5′ and 415 nucleotides of the 3′ terminal of CYMV's gRNA. The sequence of the prototype 1.2-kb RNA reveals that the two terminal gRNA regions present in this RNA encode a single open reading frame (ORF) joining the N-terminus of the 191-kDa nonstructural product and the C-terminus of the coat protein to form a 35-kDa 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product. The coding properties of this prototype RNA have been confirmed by translation in vitro of native and synthetic transcripts of the 1.2-kb RNAs, both of which direct the synthesis of the anticipated 35-kDa product which reacts with anti-CYMV antiserum. Three additional 1.2-kb RNA species, each of which contains a unique junction site, have been characterized. In all cases, a fusion ORF encoding a 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product is encoded on the RNA. The presence of a fusion ORF in all members of the 1.2-kb RNA species analyzed suggests that maintenance of this ORF may be important for the survival of this class of RNA within the plant.

In the JHM strain of MHV, expression of the HE gene is variable and corresponds to the number of copies of a UCUAA pentanucleotide sequence present at the 3′-end of the leader RNA. This copy number varies among MHV strains, depending on their passage history. The JHM isolates with two copies of UCUAA in their leader RNA showed a high level of HE expression, whereas the JHM isolate with three copies had a low-level expression. In this study, the analysis of HE gene expression was extended to other MHV strains. The synthesis of HE mRNA in these viruses also correlates with the copy number of UCUAA in the leader RNA and the particular intergenic sequence preceding the HE gene. In one MHV strain, MHV-1, no detectable HE mRNA was synthesized, despite the presence of a proper transcription initiation signal. This lack of HE mRNA expression was consistent with a leader RNA containing three UCUAA copies. However, mutations and deletions within the coding region of the MHV-1 HE gene have generated a stretch of sequence which resembled the transcriptional initiation motif, and was shown to initiate the synthesis of a novel smaller mRNA. These findings strengthened the theory that interactions between leader RNA and transcriptional initiation sequences regulate MHV subgenomic mRNA transcription. Sequence analysis revealed that most MHV strains, through extensive mutations, deletions, or insertions, have lost the complete HE open reading frame, thus turning HE into a pseudogene. This high degree of variation is unusual as the other three structural proteins (spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid) are well-maintained. In contrast to bovine coronavirus, which apparently requires HE for viral replication, the HE protein in MHV may be only an accessory protein which is not necessary for viral replication. JHM and MHV-S, however, have preserved the expression of HE protein.",1991-08-31,"Yokomori, Kyoko; Banner, Lisa R.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

During the ribosomal frameshift event, the gag open reading frame is shifted -1 nt to allow in-phase reading of the pol open reading frame. A consensus frameshift signal sequence of GGGAAAC within the gag-pol overlap region of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has been identified followed by a sequence that has the potential for a pseudoknot tertiary structure. Using recombinant baculoviruses in which the frameshift occurs efficiently, the consensus sequence has been shown to be the site of the frameshift event. A mutation creating a termination codon just downstream of the putative frameshift signal sequence but upstream of the potential pseudoknot structure made a shorter gag product, but did not affect the efficiency of frameshifting. A mutation creating a termination codon just upstream of the putative frameshift signal made a shorter product and essentially abrogated frameshifting. Mutations in the first stem or the second stem in the potential pseudoknot structure severely reduced the frameshifting efficiency. Mutations which altered the length between the frameshift signal and the pseudoknot structure (the so-called spacer region) also reduced the frameshift efficiency. The insertion of a palindromic sequence, which could form a hairpin structure just upstream of the frameshift signal sequence, also affected the frameshifting. These results support the view that the ribosomal frameshift event in the FIV gag-pol region involves the identified signal sequence and appears to require the precisely positioned downstream sequence and indicated pseudoknot structure for efficient frameshifting.",1992-02-29,"Morikawa, Shigeru; Bishop, David H.L.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

As TRTV was known to generate polycistronic mRNAs, cDNA was generated from TRTV strain U K/3 BV/85-infected Vero cell mRNAs using an oligonucleotide primer corresponding to a region of the F gene. Sequencing of four cDNAs revealed that the gene adjacent to the beginning (3′ end) of the F gene was that for the matrix (M) protein, i.e., that TRTV had the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. This was unexpected as human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, the type species of the genus Pneumovirus, has the partial gene order 3′-M-SH-G-F-5′, where SH and G are the small hydrophobic protein and attachment glycoprotein, respectively. Instead TRTV resembled the Morbillivirus and Paramyxovirus genera of the Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Paramyxoviridae) which have the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. Two further oligonucleotides, one corresponding to a sequence near the end of the M gene and the other (oligo B) to a sequence near the beginning of the F gene, with their 5′ ends spaced 300 nucleotides apart on the basis of the cDNA sequence, were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic RNA as template. Only a PCR product of 0.3 kb was obtained. The same sized product was also obtained using these oligonucleotides and genomic RNA from three other TRTV strains (SA/91 /78, UK/8544/85, and SA/2381/88) which had been grown in chicken tracheal organ cultures. In addition PCR was performed using genomic RNA from TRTV-3BV and SA/2381/88 with oligo B and another oligonucleotide near the 5′ end of the gene upstream from M, spaced 1141 nucleotides apart on the basis of the sequence data. Only a 1.14-kb PCR product was obtained. Larger products would have been expected if another gene had been situated between M and F. The absence of such larger products, plus the demonstration that infected cells contained M-F dicistronic mRNAs, supported the conclusion that in the TRTV genome the M gene is adjacent to the F gene in the order 3'-M-F-5′. The 5′ termini of the M and F mRNAs were confirmed by mRNA mapping. The TRTV M gene encoded a protein of 254 amino acids, very similar to that of RS virus (256 residues; 37% amino acid identity) but very different from that of the morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses (approximately 350 residues). Thus, on the basis of the sequences of both the M and the F genes, TRTV is more closely related to the pneumoviruses than to the paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses.",1992-02-29,"Yu, Q.; Davis, P.J.; Li, J.; Cavanagh, D.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Previous investigations have shown that the MHV spike (S) protein is a critical determinant of viral tropism and pathogenicity in mice and rats. To understand the molecular basis of MHV neuropathogenesis, we studied the spike protein gene sequences of several neutralization-resistant variants of the JHM strain of MHV, which were selected with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the S protein. We found that variant 2.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.2.2 and primarily caused demyelination, had a single point mutation at nucleotide (NT) 3340, as compared to the parental JHM virus, which predominantly caused encephalitis. This site was in the S2 subunit of the S protein. In contrast, variant 7.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.7.2 and primarily caused encephalitis, had two point mutations at NT 1766 and 1950, which were in the S1 subunit. Finally, the double mutant 2.2/7.2-V-2, which was selected with both MAbs J.2.2 and J.7.2, and was attenuated with respect to both virulence and the ability to cause demyelination, had a deletion spanning from NT 1523 to 1624 in the S1 and a point mutation at NT 3340 in the S2. We conclude that at least two regions of the S protein contribute to neuropathogenicity of MHV. We have also isolated a partial revertant of 2.2-V-1, which was partially resistant to MAb 1.2.2 but retained the same neuropathogenicity as the variant 2.2-V-1. This revenant retained the mutation at NT 3340, but had a second-site mutation at NT 1994, further confirming that NT 3340 contributed to the pathogenic phenotype of MHV. By comparing these results with MHV variants isolated in other laboratories, which had mutations in other sites on the S gene and yet retained the demyelinating ability, we suggest that the ability of JHM viruses to induce demyelination is determined by the interaction of multiple sites on the S gene, rather than the characteristics of a single, unique site. Our study also revealed the possible presence of microheterogeneity of S gene sequence, particularly in the S1 region, in these viruses. The sequence microheterogeneity may also contribute to the differences in their biological properties.",1992-02-29,"Wang, F.-I.; Fleming, John O.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

This Fc-binding activity appeared to be mediated by the MHV S protein. S protein could also be precipitated from MHV-infected cells by a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine Fc γ receptor (FcγR). To prove definitively that the S protein mediates Fc-binding activity, we have expressed the MHV S protein utilizing recombinant vaccinia viruses. The anti-FcγR monoclonal antibody, 2.4G2, precipitated recombinant S protein in cells of murine, human, and rabbit origin. Since the anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody does not react with human and rabbit Fc receptors these results demonstrate that the epitope recognized by this antibody is carried on the MHV S protein and is not murine in origin. Examination of various MHV isolates and escape mutants failed to identify the precise sequences in S responsible for the molecular mimicry of the murine FcγR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a previously identified region of similarity between the S protein and the FcγR mediates this activity. The Fc binding activity of S was expressed on the cell surface, since MHV-JHM-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody-coated SRBC.

This protein is now shown to promote the spread of MHV into cells lacking the specific CEA-related MHV receptor.

Truncated peptides C6E (residues 125–139), C9B (residues 205–216), and C11E (residues 260–272) were shown to be involved directly to the T cell determinants of C6, C9, and C11, respectively. Genetic restriction of these T cell clones was analyzed by using human cell lines with various HLA-DR phenotypes as targets and/or antigen-presenting cells in cytotoxicity assay and/or proliferation assays. The results indicated that the recognition of peptide C6 by T cell clones (R11 and R18) was associated with DRw9 molecule, while the HLA restriction element of the responses of other T cell clones (A2 and A11, A10, and A12) that reacted with peptide C9 or C11 was DR4 molecule.

The predicted common structural elements occur in the 3′ end of a segment that is critical for internal ribosome binding, termed “ribosome landing pad” (RLP), of polioviruses. Base pairings between highly conserved 17-nucleotide (nt) and 21-nt sequences in the 5′ UTR of human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses constitute a predicted pseudoknot that is significantly more stable than those that can be formed from a large set of randomly shuffled sequences. A conserved single-stranded polypyrimidine tract is located between two conserved tertiary elements. R. Nicholson, J. Pelletier, S.-Y. Le, and N. Sonenberg (1991, J. Virol. 65, 5886–5894) demonstrated that the point mutations of 3-nt UUU out of an essential 4-nt pyrimidine stretch sequence UUUC abolished translation. Structural analysis of the mutant sequence indicates that small point mutations within the short polypyrimidine sequence would destroy the tertiary interaction in the predicted, highly ordered structure. The proposed common tertiary structure can offer experimentalists a model upon which to extend the interpretations for currently available data. Based on these structural features possible base-pairing models between human enteroviruses and 18 S rRNA and between human rhinoviruses and 18 S rRNA are proposed. The proposed common structure implicates a biological function for these sequences in translational initiation.",1992-12-31,"Le, Shu-Yun; Chen, Jih-H.; Sonenberg, Nahum; Maizel, Jacob V.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Viruses purified from supernatants of ammonium chloride-treated cells contained prM protein and were unable to fuse C6/36 mosquito cells from without. When ammonium chloride was removed from the cells, both the processing of prM and the fusion activity of the purified viruses were partially restored. By using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the envelope (E) glycoprotein of MVE virus, we found that at least three epitopes were less accessible to their corresponding antibodies in the prM-containing MVE virus particles. Amino-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments of the E protein which were reactive with sequence-specific peptide antisera or MAb enabled us to estimate the site of the E protein interacting with the prM to be within amino acids 200 to 327. Since prM-containing viruses were up to 400-fold more resistant to a low pH environment, we conclude that the E-prM interaction might be necessary to protect the E protein from irreversible conformational changes caused by maturation into the acidic vesicles of the exocytic pathway.",1992-12-31,"Guirakhoo, Farshad; Bolin, Richard A.; Roehrig, John T.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Here we have performed a mutagenic analysis to identify the active site residues of this proteinase. Substitution of other amino acids for either Cys-481 or His-558 completely abolished proteolytic processing of Sindbis virus polyproteins in vitro. Substitutions within this domain for a second cysteine conserved among alphaviruses, for four other conserved histidines, or for a conserved serine did not affect the activity of the enzyme. These results suggest that nsP2 is a papain-like proteinase whose catalytic dyad is composed of Cys-481 and His-558. Since an asparagine residue has been implicated in the active site of papain, we changed the four conserved asparagine residues in the C-terminal half of nsP2 and found that all could be substituted without total loss of activity. Among papain-like proteinases, the residue following the catalytic histidine is alanine or glycine in the plant and animal enzymes, and the presence of Trp-559 in alphaviruses is unusual. A mutant enzyme containing Ala-559 was completely inactive, implying that Trp-559 is essential for a functional proteinase. All of these mutations were introduced into a full-length clone of Sindbis virus from which infectious RNA could be transcribed in vitro, and the effects of these changes on viability were tested. In all cases it was found that mutations which abolished proteolytic activity were lethal, whether or not these mutations were in the catalytic residues, indicating that proteolysis of the nonstructural polyprotein is essential for Sindbis replication.",1992-12-31,"Strauss, Ellen G.; De Groot, Raoul J.; Levinson, Randy; Strauss, James H.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

To determine the basis for this difference in neurovirulence we have studied the acute central nervous system (CNS) infection of these two viruses by in situ hybridization. Both viruses infected the same, specific neuroanatomical areas, predominantly neurons, and spread via the cerebrospinal fluid, along neuronal pathways and between adjacent cells. The neuronal nuclei infected and the spread of virus within the brain are described. The main difference between the parental and variant viruses was the rate at which the infection spread. MHV-4 spread rapidly, destroying large numbers of neurons and the animals died within 4 days of infection. The variant virus spread to the same areas of the brain but at a slower rate. This difference in the rate of virus spread was also apparent from the brain virus titers. The slower rate of spread of the variant virus appears to allow intervention by the immune response. Consistent with this, the variant virus spread slowly in athymic nu/nu mice, but in the absence of an intact immune response, infection and destruction of neurons eventually reached the same extent as that of the parental virus and the mice died within 6 days of infection. We conclude that the V5A13.1 variant of MHV-4 is neuroattenuated by its slower rate of spread in the CNS.",1992-03-31,"Fazakerley, John K.; Parker, Suezanne E.; Bloom, Floyd; Buchmeier, Michael J.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Nucleotide changes occurred in genes coding for all virion and nonvirion proteins, and in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions. Twenty-seven of the nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid alterations. The greatest amino acid sequence differences in the virion proteins occurred in prM (2.20%; 2 91 amino acids) followed by the M protein (1.33%; 1 75 amino acids), the C protein (0.88%; 1 114 amino acid), and the E protein (0.61%; 3 495 amino acids). Differences in the amino acid sequence of nonvirion proteins ranged from 1.51% ( 6 398 amino acids) in NS4 to 0.33% ( 3 900 amino acids) in NS5. The encoded protein sequences of 16681-PDK53 were also compared with the published sequences of other flaviviruses to obtain a detailed classification of 17 flaviviruses using the neighbor-joining tree method. The analyses of the sequence data produced dendrograms which supported the traditional groupings based on serological evidence, and they suggested that the flaviviruses have evolved by divergent mutational change and there was no evidence of genetic recombination between members of the group.

Five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the 10K recombinant product immunoprecipitated a polypeptide of a similar size in TGEV-infected cells. Immunofluorescence assays performed both on insect and mammalian cells revealed that ORF4 was a membrane-associated protein, a finding consistent with the prediction of a membrane-spanning segment in ORF4 sequence. Two epitopes were localized within the last 21 C-terminal residues of the sequence through peptide scanning and analysis of the reactivity of a truncated ORF4 recombinant protein. Since the relevant MAbs were found to induce a cell surface fluorescence, these data suggest that ORF4 may be an integral membrane protein having a Cexo-Nendo orientation. Anti-ORF4 MAbs were also used to show that ORF4 polypeptide may be detected in TGEV virion preparations, with an estimated number of 20 molecules incorporated per particle. Comparison of amino acid sequence data provided strong evidence that other coronaviruses encode a polypeptide homologous to TGEV ORF4.

Pretreatment of erythrocytes with neuraminidase rendered the cells resistant to agglutination by IBV. Susceptibility to agglutination was restored by resialylation of asialo-erythrocytes to contain α2,3-linked sialic acid. These results indicate that IBV attaches to receptors on erythrocytes, the crucial determinant of which is sialic acid α2,3-linked to galactose.

Temperature-sensitive mutants were isolated using 5-fluorouracil and 5-azacytidine as mutagen. Six RNA+ mutants that reside within a single complementation group mapping within the S glycoprotein gene of MHV-A59 were isolated which did not cause syncytium at the restrictive temperature. Using standard genetic techniques, a recombination map was established that indicated that these mutants mapped into two distinct domains designated F1 and F2. These genetic domains may correspond to mutations mapping within the S1 and S2 glycoproteins, respectively, and suggest that both the S1 and S2 domains are important in eliciting the fusogenic activity of the S glycoprotein gene. In addition, assuming that most distal is alleles map roughly 4.0 kb apart, a recombination frequency of 1 % per 575–676 by was predicted through the S glycoprotein gene. Interestingly, this represents a threefold increase in the recombination frequency as compared to rates predicted through the polymerase region. The increase in the recombination rate was probably not due to recombination events resulting in large deletions or insertions (>50 bp), but rather was probably due to a combination of homologous and nonhomologous recombination.

These included the previously identified N-terminal ORF 1a product, p28, as well as 290-, 240-, and 50-kDa polypeptides. P28 was always detected as a discrete band without larger precursors, suggesting rapid cleavage of p28 immediately after its synthesis. Once p28 was cleaved there was little degradation of the protein over a 2-hr period. The intracellular cleavage of p28 was not inhibited by the protease inhibitor leupeptin, in contrast to results obtained during in vitro translation of genome RNA (Denison and Perlman, 1986). These data suggest that different protease activities may be responsible for the cleavage of p28 in vitro and in vivo. The 290-kDa protein was an intermediate cleavage product derived from a precursor of greater than 400 kDa. The 290-kDa product was subsequently cleaved into secondary products of 50 and 240 kDa. The intracellular cleavage of the 290-kDa polypeptide was inhibited by leupeptin at concentrations which did not inhibit the early cleavage of p28 or the cleavage of the 290-kDa product from its larger polyprotein precursor. In the presence of zinc chloride, a product of >320 kDa was detected, which appears to incorporate p28 at its amino terminus. This suggests that at least two protease activities may be necessary for processing of ORF1a proteins, one of which cleaves p28 and is sensitive to zinc chloride but resistant to leupeptin, and the other which cleaves the 290-kDa precursor and is sensitive to both inhibitors. Both the 290- and 240-kDa proteins should contain sequences predicted to encode two papain-like protease activities.",1992-07-31,"Denison, Mark R.; Zoltick, Philip W.; Hughes, Scott A.; Giangreco, Bernadette; Olson, Ann L.; Perlman, Stanley; Leibowitz, Julian L.; Weiss, Susan R.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

The mutant was able to grow in a subline of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK II) which is resistant to infection by the parent virus due to a lack of receptors. Inactivation of cellular receptors by either neuraminidase or acetylesterase and generation of receptors by resialylation of cells with N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) indicated that 9-O-acetylated sialic acid is a receptor determinant for both parent and mutant virus. However, the mutant required less Neu5,9Ac2 on the cell surface for virus attachment than the parent virus. The increased binding efficiency enabled the mutant to infect cells with a low content of 9-O-acetylated sialic acid which were resistant to the parent virus. By comparing the nucleotide sequences of the glycoprotein (HEF) genes of the parent and the mutant virus only a single point mutation could be identified on the mutant gene. This mutation at nucleotide position 872 causes an amino acid exchange from threonine to isoleucine at position 284 on the amino acid sequence.

Previously, we have identified a transcription initiation site (for mRNA 2-1), which is more efficiently transcribed by viruses containing two copies of UCUAA sequence in the leader RNA than by those with three copies. In this study, we have identified several sites which are regulated in the opposite way, namely, they are efficiently transcribed by the leader RNA with three UCUAA copies but not by those with two copies. These sites were characterized by primer extension and amplification by polymerase chain reaction. One of these sites is in the gene 3 region of a recombinant virus between A59 and JHM strains of MHV. Another is in the gene 2 region of MHV-1 strain. Both of these sites have a sequence similar to but different from the consensus transcription initiation signal (UCUAAUCUAUC and UUUAAUCUU, as opposed to UCUAAAC). These two novel intergenic sequences are not present in the genome of the JHM strain, consistent with the absence of these mRNAs in the JHM-infected cells. The discovery of this type of transcription initiation site provides additional evidence for the importance of the leader RNA in the transcription initiation of MHV mRNAs.",1992-05-31,"La Monica, Nicola; Yokomori, Kyoko; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,,,True,custom_license

Nonenteropathogenic porcine respiratory coronaviruses (PRCVs) have been derived from TGEV. The genetic relationship among six European PRCVs and five coronaviruses of the TGEV antigenic cluster has been determined based on their RNA sequences. The S protein of six PRCVs have an identical deletion of 224 amino acids starting at position 21. The deleted area includes the antigenic sites C and B of TGEV S glycoprotein. Interestingly, two viruses (NEB72 and TOY56) with respiratory tropism have S proteins with a size similar to the enteric viruses. NEB72 and TOY56 viruses have in the S protein 2 and 15 specific amino acid differences with the enteric viruses. Four of the residues changed (aa 219 of NEB72 isolate and as 92, 94, and 218 of TOY56) are located within the deletion present in the PRCVs and may be involved in the receptor binding site (RBS) conferring enteric tropism to TGEVs. A second RBS used by the virus to infect ST cells might be located in a conserved area between sites A and D of the S glycoprotein, since monoclonal antibodies specific for these sites inhibit the binding of the virus to ST cells. An evolutionary tree relating 13 enteric and respiratory isolates has been proposed. According to this tree, a main virus lineage evolved from a recent progenitor virus which was circulating around 1941. From this, secondary lineages originated PUR46, NEB72, TOY56, MIL65, BR170, and the PRCVs, in this order. Least squares estimation of the origin of TGEV-related coronaviruses showed a significant constancy in the fixation of mutations with time, that is, the existence of a well-defined molecular clock. A mutation fixation rate of 7 ± 2 × 10−4 nucleotide substitutions per site and per year was calculated for TGEV-related viruses. This rate falls in the range reported for other RNA viruses. Point mutations and probably recombination events have occurred during TGEV evolution.",1992-09-30,"Sánchez, Carlos M.; Gebauer, Fátima; Suñé, Carlos; Mendez, Ana; Dopazo, Joaquín; Enjuanes, Luis",Virology,,,False,custom_license

The recombinant gl had an apparent molecular weight of 116 kDa and was partially cleaved to yield 63-kDa (glb) and 52-kDa (glc) subunits. This processing step was significantly less efficient in insect cells than the analogous step in mammalian cells, even though the cleavage sites of authentic and recombinant gl were shown to be identical. The oligosaccharide linkages were mostly endoglycosidase-H-sensitive, in contrast to those of authentic gl, which has mostly endoglycosidase-H-resistant linkages and an apparent molecular weight of 130/74/55 kDa. Despite the reduced cleavage and altered glycosylation, the recombinant glycoprotein was transported and expressed on the surface of infected insect cells. These surface molecules were biologically active as demonstrated by their ability to induce cell-cell fusion. Fusion was inhibited bythree monoclonal antibodies specific for antigenic domains I and IV on gl. Domain I maps to the extracellular region of the carboxy terminal fragment glc and domain IV to the very amino terminus of the glb fragment, indicating that domains mapping in two distinct regions of gl function in cell fusion.

In situ hybridization was approx. 40% more sensitive than either of these other methods as determined by average virus titers for the different samples, and also proved to be better by means of a nonparametric comparison. The 293 cell line was approx. 5 times more sensitive for detecting adenoviruses by cytopathogenicity as compared with the HEp-2 cell line, but proved unsuitable in our hands for quantitatively detecting indigenous adenoviruses by immunofluorescence.

Incorporation of [3H]mannose into N-linked glycoproteins by aged cells was further reduced (∼35%). Similarly microsomal membranes from parotid glands of aged animals showed ∼50% reduction in the synthesis of mannosylphosphoryl dolichol, a key intermediate in the dolichol pathway of protein N-glycosylation. Man-P-Dol synthase, the microsomal enzyme responsible for production of this saccharide-lipid, displayed no change in apparent K m for GDP-mannose when preparations from aged animals were utilized, but did show ∼50% reduction in V max. Following β-adrenoreceptor activation, cells from both young adult and aged glands showed increased N-linked protein glycosylation almost to the same extent (∼2-fold).

From 1983 to 1990, we have necropsied 45 well preserved carcasses out of a total of 120 beluga whales reported dead over this period. Of these 45 animals, nine were affected by 10 malignant neoplasms. Fifteen animals (33%) were affected by pneumonia. Milk production was compromised in eight of 17 mature females (41%), by inflammatory changes (seven animals) and cancer (one animal) which affected the mammary glands. Opportunistic bacteria were found in pure culture, and/or in significant amounts in at least two organs in 20 belugas (44%). The concentrations of both total PCBs and highly chlorinated PCB congeners were much higher in St. Lawrence animals than in Arctic beluga whales. OC-induced immunosuppression has been repeatedly demonstrated in a wide variety of animal species. Therefore, it is probable that the immune functions of St. Lawrence beluga whales are impaired. Benzo[α]pyrene adducts were detected in 10 of the 11 St. Lawrence beluga whales of which tissues (six livers, 10/11 brains) were analyzed by a method based on HPLC. No such adducts were found in four Arctic animals. Since benzo[α]pyrene is one of the most potent chemical carcinogens known to man, these compounds might be responsible for some of the cancers observed in that population. Overall, our findings contrast vividly with those of others who found that cancers are exceedingly rare in free-ranging odontocete populations and that the major causes for mortalities in these populations are bacteria, parasites, and trauma.",1994-09-16,"Martineau, D.; De Guise, S.; Fournier, M.; Shugart, L.; Girard, C.; Lagacé, A.; Béland, P.",Science of The Total Environment,,,True,custom_license

The hazards stem from chemical and microbiological agents whose nature and magnitude depend heavily on the degree of sorting and on the composting methods. Three main routes of exposure can be determined and are quantified in the literature: (i) The ingestion of soil/compost mixtures by children, mostly in cases of pica, can be a threat because of the amount of lead, chromium, cadmium, PCDD F and fecal streptococci that can be absorbed. (ii) Though concern about contamination through the food chain is weak when compost is used in agriculture, some authors anticipate accumulation of pollutants after several years of disposal, which might lead to future hazards. (iii) Exposure is also associated with atmospheric dispersion of compost organic dust that convey microorganisms and toxicants. Data on hazard posed by organic dust from municipal composts to the farmer or the private user is scarce. To date, microorganisms are only measured at composting plants, thus raising the issue of extrapolation to environmental situations. Lung damage and allergies may occur because of organic dust, Gram negative bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi.

Serine peptidases are found in viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes. They include exopeptidases, endopeptidases, oligopeptidases, and omega peptidases. On the basis of three-dimensional structures, most of the serine peptidase families can be grouped together into about six clans that may have common ancestors. The structures are known for members of four of the clans, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidase C, and Escherichia D-Ala-D-Ala peptidase A. The peptidases of chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and carboxypeptidase C clans have a common “catalytic triad” of three amino acids—namely, serine (nucleophile), aspartate (electrophile), and histidine (base). The geometric orientations of these are closely similar between families; however the protein folds are quite different. The arrangements of the catalytic residues in the linear sequences of members of the various families commonly reflect their relationships at the clan level. The members of the chymotrypsin family are almost entirely confined to animals. 10 families are included in chymotrypsin clan (SA), and all the active members of these families are endopeptidases. The order of catalytic residues in the polypeptide chain in clan SA is His/Asp/Ser.",1994-12-31,"Rawlings, Neil D.; Barrett, Alan J.",Methods in Enzymology,,,True,custom_license

Although the prevalence of the disease is moderately low, averaging about 40 cases per 100,000 people in high risk areas, it is a particularly devastating disease. It primarily affects young adults, is chronic, and has an unpredictable course. Most discouraging, the cause of the disease is not known and an effective treatment has not been identified. Recently, however, research has yielded some important findings concerning the etiology of MS. Much evidence now points to an immunological process as one of the major elements in the disease. It is also likely that an environmental influence, possibly an infectious process, may contribute to the disease. Finally, it is now certain that genetic makeup influences susceptibility to the disease. At present, the strongest evidence is for a polygenic effect, not the effect of a single gene or gene locus. This review will examine some of the possible immunologically mediated disease processes that could be involved in MS, especially those that could account for a role for infectious and genetic factors in the disease.",1989-01-31,"McFarland, Henry F.; Dhib-Jalbut, Suhayl",Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

Simulataneous behavioral time course studies showed that cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p<0.0001) increased ambulations (locomotor activity), fine movements (stereotypic movements of sniffing and grooming) and rearing behavior, while significantly decreasing agoraphobic behavior, as measured by a statistically significant increase in central ambulations (p<0.0001). The high dose of cocaine (40 mg/kg SC) significantly increased fine movements over those produced by the lower doses of cocaine (p<0.0002). One import of the findings is that the DA and 5-HT biogenic amine response occurs in a behavioral paradigm of psychomotor stimulation, which is a known measure of reinforcement. Another is that the biogenic amines DA and 5-HT are affected by cocaine in this reinforcement paradigm with exactly opposite directionality. Finally, acute cocaine administration is shown to produce a dose response inhibition of agoraphobia (fear),w hich is highly correlated (ϱ=.983, p<0.01) with the opposing effects of cocaine on the accumbens biogenic amines, DA and 5-HT.",1991-12-31,"Broderick, Patricia A.",Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior,,,True,custom_license

Psychostimulant behaviors were significantly correlated with concurrently changing synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.01) and also with 5-HT to a lesser degree. Additionally, behavioral data indicate that cocaine may exhibit an anxiolytic effect during acute administration because agoraphobic behavior, as shown by increased central ambulatory behavior, was dramatically reduced by cocaine. Summarily, the present findings show that cocaine increased synaptic concentrations of DA in VTA, an action that is correlated with cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior. The DA-ergic effect appears to be tonically maintained. Furthermore, new findings demonstrate a colocalized, cocaine induced 5-HT-ergic effect in VTA, which keeps pace with cocaine-induced alterations in DA-ergic neurotransmission. Thus, 5-HT may be a relay or a gating mechanism for a DA reward signalling pathway for cocaine.",1992-08-31,"Broderick, Patricia A.",Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior,,,True,custom_license

In further in vivo voltammetric studies, the effects of SC cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT were studied in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm in two neuroanatomic substrates, NAcc and mesoaccumbens somatodendrites, the ventral tegmental area (VTA-A10), in a dose-response fashion (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in six separate studies. Moreover, in two additional in vivo voltammetric studies, again using the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm, the impulse flow blocker, γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL) (750 mg/kg, IP), was studied alone and in combination with SC cocaine (20 mg/kg) to determine whether or not cocaine can act by presynaptic releasing mechanisms for DA and 5-HT. The results show that IV cocaine concurrently and significantly increased DA and 5-HT release in the NAcc (p < 0.001, p < 0.0005, respectively) at both doses tested. Moreover, IV cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). On the other hand, SC cocaine concurrently and significantly decreased DA and 5-HT release in NAcc (p < 0.0001) and VTA (p < 0.0001) at each separate dose tested. SC cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated across dose and neuroanatomic substrate (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the γ-BL studies indicate that cocaine's action includes a presynaptic release mechanism for the biogenic amines. Summarily, the data show that a consideration of the route of cocaine administration is crucial in determining the underlying neurochemical basis for cocaine.",1992-11-30,"Broderick, Patricia A.",Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior,,,True,custom_license

Miniature stearate probes detected DA and 5-HT release, on line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Psychostimulant behaviors, in the form of four behavioral components (i.e., the classically DA-dependent behaviors of locomotor activity [ambulations], rearing, and stereotypy, and a 5-HT-ergic behavior, central ambulations) were studied concurrently with infrared photobeam detection. The results show that (IP) cocaine significantly increased vlNAcc DA release (p < 0.0001) and 5-HT release (p < 0.0012). Each of the four parameters of cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior was concurrently and significantly increased as well (ambulations: p < 0.0001; rearing: p < 0.0008; stereotypy: p < 0.0004; central ambulations: p < 0.0082). Moreover, exactly coincident data points for DA and 5-HT release occurred 10 and 40 min after (IP) cocaine administration. Cocaine-induced DA and 5-HT release were highly and positively correlated during the first hour of study (p < 0.01). As expected, increased DA release in vlNAcc after cocaine administration was significantly and positively correlated with classically DA-dependent behaviors (first- and second-hour effects) (p < 0.01) and with the 5-HT-ergic behavior, central ambulations (p < 0.01). Also, cocaine-induced 5-HT release was significantly and positively correlated with 5-HT behavior (p < 0.01). However, not as expected, classically DA-dependent behaviors were more positively correlated with cocaine-induced 5-HT release in vlNAcc throughout the two-hour period of study. Thus, the present findings show that 5-HT is a comediator with DA in the cocaine response in vlNAcc.

The behavioral parameters were: a) locomotor activity (ambulations), b) rearing, c) stereotypy (fine movements, primarily grooming), and d) agoraphobia [(thigmotaxis) a natural tendency to avoid the center of the behavioral chamber]. With each behavioral data point, dopamine (DA) release, and serotonin (5-HT) release were detected within seconds in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of the same behaving male Sprague-Dawley rats, using in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry). Ibogaine was administered (40 mg/kg IP) for 4 consecutive days. Importantly, the DAergic and the 5-HTergic responses to (SC) cocaine and two behavioral responses, ambulations and central ambulations, were reduced in intensity due to extended time spent in the novel behavioral chamber (habituated). Rearing and fine movement patterns were not habituated. The results show that ibogaine downmodulated the (SC) cocaine-induced increase in NAcc DA release (p < 0.0001) and potentiated the (SC) cocaine-induced decrease in NAcc 5-HT release (p < 0.0001). Concurrently, ibogaine downmodulated cocaine-induced ambulation (p < 0.0001) and central ambulation behavior (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the behavioral parameters that did not exhibit habituation, i.e., rearing behavior and fine movement behavior, were not downmodulated by ibogaine (p < 0.1558) (p < 0.3763), respectively. Furthermore, ibogaine itself did not significantly alter NAcc DA release over the 2-h period studied (p < 0.9113) although individual time points were significantly affected bidirectionally. Concurrently ibogaine significantly increased 5-HT release (p < 0.0155). Behaviorally, ibogaine appears to be a weak psychostimulant. The data show a critical modulatory role for 5-HT in ibogaine-cocaine interactions. Also elucidated as critical is the efficacy of ibogaine when the response to (SC) cocaine is decreased due to the habituation of the animals to their environment.",1994-11-30,"Broderick, Patricia A.; Phelan, Frank T.; Eng, Frank; Wechsler, Robert T.",Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior,,,True,custom_license

Upper respiratory infections (URI) occurred in these 11 allergic children 1 to 2 months prior to the onset of allergic sensitization. In 10 of these 11 URI children, complement-fixing antibodies to viruses (parainfluenza, RSV, CMV) increased in the same blood samples in which immunologic allergic sensitization was first evidenced.

For example, bronchial hyperresponsiveness may be seen in patients with allergic rhinitis. This could represent coexistent but unrecognized asthma, but also suggests that IgE-dependent inflammation may occur in the lower airway that can increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness without at the same time precipitating obvious obstruction. Clearly, allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for asthma. A second example of the interaction of upper airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity are reports that viral upper respiratory tract infections may cause otherwise healthy persons to respond abnormally to inhaled histamine or irritants for several months after the infections. These same viruses usually precipitate attacks in patients with asthma, who already have hyperresponsive airways.

Most histamine release occurred during the first 15 to 30 minutes after challenge, depending on the dose of virus used; release initiated by virus was complete by 1 hour. At a virus/cell ratio of 1:1, Sendai virus caused 41 ± 9% histamine release, whereas parainfluenza type 3 (PI-3) virus caused 25 ± 5% release and respiratory syncytial (RS) virus caused 19 ± 5% release. Sendai, but not PI-3 or RS, also caused a decrease in cell number and release of lactic dehydrogenase; however, this apparent cell lysis did not account for all the histamine released. Incubation of cells with virus desensitized them to subsequent triggering by viruses but did not affect response of cells to other stimuli. Histamine release was dependent on the virus/cell ratio, temperature, and metabolic energy, but it was not strictly dependent on the presence of calcium in the extracellular medium. Histamine release was not affected by preincubation of cells with colchicine, suggesting that microtubules were not involved in the release process. Basophils desensitized by anti-IgE in the absence of calcium or treated with lactic acid to dissociate IgE molecules from membrane receptors released amounts of histamine similar to that of control basophils; thus, release was not initiated through Fcϵ receptors. It was found, however, that histamine release by these viruses was greatly reduced when concanavalin A was used for desensitization. These data demonstrate that the respiratory viruses studied can cause direct nonimmunologic release of histamine from human basophils.

Before challenge and on each of 6 days of cloister, all volunteers were interviewed for symptoms and completed a test battery consisting of evaluations of secretion production by weighed tissues, nasal patency by active posterior rhinomanometry, nasal clearance by the dyed saccharin technique, pulmonary function by spirometry, eustachian tube function by sonotubometry, and middle ear status by tympanometry. The symptomatology and pathophysiology resulting from the rhinovirus infection were consistent with those reported in previous studies with this challenge system. Between-group comparisons revealed no differences in symptom presentation, nasal secretion production, or overall pathophysiologic response. However, for decreased mucociliary clearance rate, increased nasal congestion, eustachian tube dysfunction, and symptoms of sneezing, the allergic group demonstrated an earlier onset compared with that of the nonallergic group. The biologic significance of the differences in onset of dysfunction is tempered by the observation that the temporal pattern of responses in the allergic group was similar with that of nonallergic subjects in previous studies.

This was most evident in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with JHM. Such CNS lesions were not observed in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with the MHV3 strain. An in vitro system is described in which the rat glial RN2 cell line functions as a discriminating host for the JHM virus. Shortly after inoculation, this virus establishes a persistent infection in which there is a cyclical rise and fall in titer with an accompanying cytopathology. Furthermore, this host cell confers a thermal lability which the virus does not demonstrate in the fully permissive host cell, L-2. By comparison, infection of RN2 cells with the prototype MHV3 is aborted immediately. In the persistent infection of RN2 cells with measles virus, Hallé strain, the cell again confers a temperature sensitivity which the virus does not possess when replicating in Vero cells. This appears to be the first instance in which a cloned cell line of glial origin determines the outcome of the infectious process, discriminating in favor of a neurotropic variant which possesses a tropism for the glia in vivo.

Fatty acid acylation (principally of gE) could be detected just prior to the shifts, whereas conversion of high-mannosetype N-linked oligosaccharides to the complex type occurred coincident with the shifts. The addition of O-linked oligosaccharides did not occur in cells treated with the ionophore monensin or in a ricinresistant cell line defective in the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides.

With the exception of the SL sequence and a concensus donor splice site immediately following it, these small RNAs are not well conserved.

While wild-type G forms an oligomer in the RER, ts045 G synthesized at the nonpermissive temperature does not. When the permissive temperature is reinstated, ts045 G forms an oligomer and moves to the Golgi. The state of oligomerization was determined by chemical cross-linking and by the ability of a microinjected monoclonal antibody specific for the carboxy-terminal five amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of G to cause patching of G in intracellular membranes. We conclude that formation of an oligomer of G protein, probably a trimer, is necessary for G protein maturation.",1986-09-12,"Kreis, Thomas E.; Lodish, Harvey F.",Cell,,,True,custom_license

Sequence analysis of the recombinant junctions of 13 nonsibling intertypic recombinants showed that intertypic RNA recombination is not site-specific, nor does it require extensive homology between the recombining parents at the crossover site. To discriminate between breaking-rejoining and copy choice mechanisms of RNA recombination, we have inhibited the replication of the recombining parents independently and found opposite effects on the frequency of genetic recombination in intratypic crosses. The results strongly support a copy choice mechanism for RNA recombination, in which the viral RNA polymerase switches templates during negative strand synthesis.",1986-11-07,"Kirkegaard, Karla; Baltimore, David",Cell,,,True,custom_license

This “mini-exon” sequence is derived from the 5′ end of a 137 nucleotide RNA (medRNA). The remainder of each mRNA is derived from a protein-coding exon that is not linked to the mini-exon. We propose that medRNA is spliced in trans to de-novo-initiated transcripts of protein-coding genes. This trans splicing model predicts that the downstream portion of medRNA will be part of a branched structure and then be released as a free product (minRNA). We demonstrate that significant levels of minRNA exist in trypanosome RNA. Furthermore, minRNA can be released from high molecular weight RNA by a HeLa cell S100 “debranching” extract.

When the exoplasmic domain of Iγ is replaced by the cytoplasmic protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), CAT becomes the exoplasmic, glycosylated domain of the resulting membrane protein IγCAT∗. Deletion of the hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain from IγCAT gives rise to a secreted protein from which an amino-terminal segment is cleaved, most likely by signal peptidase.

Moreover, the leader sequences map either upstream or downstream of the late gene, are transcribed from either DNA strand, and are fused to the late gene coding sequence via a poly(A) stretch.

We show here that the E19 protein is retained in the ER even in the absence of class I antigens. To define the region conferring residency in the ER, we examined two mutant forms of the viral protein. A 5 amino acid extension of the 15-membered cytoplasmic tail of the protein reduces its interaction with class I antigens but does not change its intracellular distribution. Shortening the tail to 7 amino acids also diminishes the affinity for class I antigens; however, this mutant E19 protein becomes transported to the cell surface. Thus, we concluded that a small stretch of amino acids exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane is responsible for the retention of the E19 protein in the ER.",1987-07-17,"Pääbo, Svante; Bhat, Bheem M.; Wold, William S.M.; Peterson, Per A.",Cell,,,False,custom_license

The gag terminator, which immediately follows the frameshift site, is not required for frameshifting. Other suspected retroviral frameshift sites mediate frameshifting when placed at the end of RSV gag. Mutations in RSV pol also affect synthesis of the gag-pol protein in vitro. The effects of these mutations best correlate with the potential to form an RNA stem-loop structure adjacent to the frameshift site.

One of these nucleotide substitutions and one deletion resulted in alteration of the reading frames of two fusion genes, as confirmed by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs. One cluster of mutations was exceptional; in the matrix gene of the MIBE case, 50% of the U residues were changed to C, which might result from a highly biased copying event exclusively affecting this gene.

Any change to the sequence CUU-AGG-C drastically reduces frameshifting; this suggests that two specific tRNAs, tRNALeu UAG and tRNAArg CCU, are involved in the event. Our tRNA overproduction data suggest that a leucyl-tRNA, probably tRNALeu UAG, an unusual leucine isoacceptor that recognizes all six leucine codons, slips from CUU-Leu onto UUA-Leu (in the +1 reading frame) during a translational pause at the AGG-Arg codon induced by the low availability of tRNAArg CCU, encoded by a single-copy essential gene.

Based on the structural requirements for both MHC class 11 binding and TCR recognition of an immunodominant myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide, criteria for a data base search were developed in which the degeneracy of amino acid side chains required for MHC class 11 binding and the conservation of those required for T cell activation were considered. A panel of 129 peptides that matched the molecular mimicry motif was tested on seven MBP-specific T cell clones from multiple sclerosis patients. Seven viral and one bacterial peptide efficiently activated three of these clones. Only one peptide could have been identified as a molecular mimic by sequence alignment. The observation that a single T cell receptor can recognize quite distinct but structurally related peptides from multiple pathogens has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.",1995-03-10,"Wucherpfennig, Kai W; Strominger, Jack L",Cell,,,True,custom_license

A novel autoregulatory mechanism enables modulation of frameshifting according to the cellular concentration of polyamines. Antizyme binds to, and destabilizes, ornithine decarboxylase, a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis. Rapid degradation ensues, thus completing a regulatory circuit. In vitro experiments with a fusion construct using reticulocyte lysates demonstrate polyamine-dependent expression with a frameshift efficiency of 19% at the optimal concentration of spermidine. The frameshift is +1 and occurs at the codon just preceding the terminator of the initiating frame. Both the termination codon of the initiating frame and a pseudoknot downstream in the mRNA have a stimulatory effect. The shift site sequence, UCC-UGA-U, is not similar to other known frameshift sites. The mechanism does not seem to involve re-pairing of peptidyl-tRNA in the new frame but rather reading or occlusion of a fourth base.",1995-01-13,"Matsufuji, Senya; Matsufuji, Tamiko; Miyazaki, Youichi; Murakami, Yasuko; Atkins, John F; Gesteland, Raymond F; Hayashi, Shin-ichi",Cell,,,True,custom_license

Serum procalcitonin values decreased rapidly during antibiotic therapy. 11 patients with peripheral bacterial colonisation or local infections without invasive sepsis and 18 (86%) of 21 patients with viral infections had concentrations within or slightly above the normal range (0·1-1·5 ng/mL). Among 9 severely burned patients studied in an intensive care unit, the post-traumatic course of procalcitonin concentrations (range 0·1-120 ng/mL) was closely related to infectious complications and acute septic episodes.

The immunostimulator reduced the incidence of the disease, dead and discarded animals, as well as it shortened the mean duration of the disease in single heads. Though the way the POLI-IF acts is not perfectly known so far, yet it increases the serum bactericidal activity and the circulating leukocytes, while it induces high levels of IFN.

The results clearly indicated that rotavirus infection is widespread and supported the evidence for an etiologic role of these viruses in neonatal diarrhea. The evidence of differences in virulence among bovine rotaviruses appeared also to be confirmed. Conventionally reared calves were fully susceptible to the experimental infection induced by three rotaviruses originating from heterologous hosts, i.e. monkeys, pigs and rabbits, respectively. When rotavirus strains of bovine, simian, porcine and rabbit origin were compared by cross neutralization tests, it was found the simian and porcine strains were indistinguishable and both appeared to relate antigenically to the bovine strain. On the other hand, a reciprocal antigenic correlation was found between bovine and rabbit isolates. Finally, it was proven that feeding newborn calves with colostrum of their dams, previously vaccinated with an inactivated rotavirus vaccine, could prevent the neonatal diarrhea from occurring.",1988-12-31,"Castrucci, G; Frigeri, F; Ferrari, M; Cilli, V; Gualandi, G.L; Aldrovandi, V","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",,,True,custom_license

Les signes cliniques sont enregistrés quotidiennement et notamment la température rectale. Une cinétique sérologique est réalisée et les anticorpos anti Aujeszky, coronavirus GET-like, grippe, A/H1N1, grippe A/H3N2 et Mycoplasma hypopneumoniae sont recherchés. Des recherches virales sont conduites sur mucosités nasales d'animaux en hyperthermie ainsi que sur avortons. L'étude clinique montre une hyperthermie plus ou moins prononcée sur les animaux, les troubles persistant généralement 2 à 5 jours. Le diagnostic de grippe mettant en cause le virus H1N1 swine apparenté A/FIN/1/82 a été établi à la fois par la sérologie (séroconversion) et la mise en évidence du virus sur écouvillon nasal ainsi que sur avorton.

Abstract Pathological consequences of a severe outbreak of swine influenza (H1N1 virus) in the non immune sow at the beginning of pregnancy, under natural conditions. A sudden acute outbreak of fever, depression, anorexia and coughing in a group of nulliparous sows from a herd that was currently under epidemiological investigation lead to build a particular disposal of observation. The clinical signs were daily recorded including rectal temperature. Blood was taken from the sows at the beginning of the troubles and 3 weeks later for the detection of Aujesky's disease, coronavirus TGE-like, Influenza viruses A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. Viral detection was attempted from nasal swabs and aborted fetuses during the acute phase. The clinical study showed fever reaching near 41°C on most of the pigs and lasting usually from 2 to 5 days. The diagnosis of Influenza (virus swine H1N1) was established both on serology (massive seroconversion) and on the detection of the virus from the nasal swabs and from an aborted fetus. The control of the lungs of sows “not in pig” and culled showed extended lesions of bronchopneumonia and Pasteurella multocida was found. The technical consequences of this severe outbreak of Influenza on reproduction were mainly important at the beginning of pregnancy. Over 13 sows inseminated less than 1 week before the outbreak, only 3 farrowed (respectively 5,5 and 12 piglets); 7 returned to oestrus and 3 “not a pig” at 21 days (echotomography) did not show signs of heat and were culled. Over 8 pregnant sows (1 month of pregnancy), 6 farrowed normal litters and total embryonic resorption occurred in 2 sows. Over 18 pregnant sows (more than 45 days gestation) one aborted.",1989-12-31,"Madec, F.; Kaiser, Cl.; Gourreau, J.M.; Martinat-Botte, F.","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",,,True,custom_license

It was indispensable for generating coronavirus-specific ELISA antibody activities that the sample was applied to the mock-infected, normal CRFK cells in parallel with the CCV-infected cells and then the optical density values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen. On the basis of ELISA antibody titers obtained in sera from the cats experimentally infected with CCV and from the spontaneous feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) cases, the ELISA described in the present study was found to be applicable as a simple and easy serologic test which was able to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies as efficiently as the indirect immunofluorescence assay with homologous FIP virus.",1989-12-31,"Mochizuki, Masami; Furukawa, Hisashi","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",,,True,custom_license

Digestive disorders connected with BHV1 are in general only observed in calves and mainly in Belgium. Virus strains causing abortion or encephalitis are only present in a few countries. The same is true for BHV1 induced mastitis. Dermatitis and lesions in the interdigital space seem to be a rare event. BHV1 infections are frequently complicated by bacterial secondary infections, but there is evidence that BHV1 infections can occur simultaneously with bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) and/or parainfluenza-3 (PI 3) virus. The biggest problem associated with BHV1 infection is the ability of the agent to become latent following a primary infection. The genome of the virus probably remains during the life of the animal in the ganglia of the region where the primary infection occurred. No vaccination can overcome this latent stage. By prophylactic vaccination it is possible to prevent an outbreak of clinical disease but it is impossible to prevent infection followed by the establishment of latency. Eradication programmes in Austria, Denmark and Switzerland have removed most of the seropositive cattle from the bovine populations. Currently a sanitary programme is also being conducted in Germany.",1991-12-31,"Straub, Otto Christian","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",,,True,custom_license

Five PRV strains were used to infect AM including strains that are known to be highly virulent for pigs, i.e. strain 4892 and strain S-62 as well as strains that are regarded as mild or nonvirulent, i.e. BUK and Bartha. The multiplicity of infection ranged from 0.005 to 0.05 TCID50/cell. The target cells in the cytotoxicity assays were either chicken red blood cells, PRV-infected vero cells, or human myeloblastoma cells (K562 cell line). For the producton of IFN, AM cultures were treated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) diluted in tissue culture media at a concentration of 5 μg/106 cells. Culture supernatants were collected at various times poststimulation and tested for antiviral activity using the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus replication inhibition test. Swine AM were able to lyse chicken red blood cells in an antibody-independent way but not in an antibody-dependent way, whereas lysis of PRV-infected vero cells was accomplished both ways. The cytotoxicity against chicken red blood cells was reduced in the PRV-infected AM as compared to noninfected cells, particularly in AM infected with virulent PRV strains. Specific 51Cr release values for AM infected with S-62 and 4892 strains were 14 and 19, while the noninfected AM had values of 36. Similarly, in the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity assay against PRV-infected vero cells there was no activity of AM against K562 cells. The production of IFN was readily stimulated with Poly I:C. The optimal time for supernatant collection was between 12 and 16h poststimulation. The antiviral activity was abrogated by treatment of the supernatant with antiserum against human leukocyte IFN; it was therefore considered to be due to interferon-alpha (IFNα) released from the macrophages. The antiviral activity present in supernatants of PRV-infected AM was reduced compared to noninfected AM. The difference between AM cultures infected with virulent strains of PRV and noninfected AM cultures was statistically significant at P ⩽ 0.025. The results provide support to the premise that the role of AM in lung defense can be compromised by PRV infection.",1992-10-31,"Iglesias, Gerardo; Pijoan, Carlos; Molitor, Thomas","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",,,True,custom_license

Obvious differences in the mobility of several genomic RNA segments were observed in one-dimensional gels. Under in vitro conditions, partial proteolytic peptide mapping identified differences between the two outer capsid proteins of these virus and no difference in inner capsid protein was observed. Since it has been observed by us and others that the gene coding for VP4 protein plays a significant role in determining virulence, the variability observed in the present study between the 84 k proteins (VP4) provided a basis for further investigations in order to locate a potential virulence determinant. A comparison of the carboxypeptidase digests of the MRV- and BRV-VP4 revealed an area of variability between amino acids 307 and 407, which may represent a site of virulence determinant. Under in vivo conditions the virulence of both parenteral BRV and MRV isolates and their corresponding reassortants (with replaced gene 4) were studied in murine and bovine hosts. Like their parents, BRV and MRV isolates, reassortants obtained by replacement of gene 4 in BRV with MRV gene 4 indicated that the dose of the virus isolate used and the clinical outcome in vivo was determined by gene segment 4.

No appreciable specific lysis was observed in any group of calves indicating the absence of demonstrable CTL responses. The TC/TS population was severely depressed in the calf inoculated with the virulent virus but not in those inoculated with either the attenuated virus or placebo.

Calves inoculated with virulent virus produced higher titers of BCV antibodies in the intestines than those inoculated with the attenuated virus. The failure of the calves to respond to the attenuated virus was apparently due to the inability of the virus to replicate to high titers. Spiral colon, ileum, and jejunum were found to be immunologically distinct; the highest anti-BCV antibody responses were detected in spiral colon, the primary site of infection, and involved all four isotypes of bovine immunoglobulins.

The lowest parenteral doses (104 units per kg body wt) and the orally administered interferon did not lead to any disturbances, whereas the higher dosages led to marked changes in body temperature, pulse and respiration rates. Animals with the highest dose (108 units per kg body wt) became extremely distressed. The blood picture showed distinct changes, with very low leukocyte counts during treatment, which took weeks to recover. It is suggested that the dosages that did not lead to clinical symptoms are best suited for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes.",1995-09-30,"Straub, Otto Christian","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",,,True,custom_license

Methods: A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE (1966–August 2004) and InternationalPharmaceutical Abstracts (1970–August 2004) databases with the search terms daptomycin, LY146032, and lipopeptide antibiotics. Abstracts of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and documents submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration were also reviewed. Results: Phase III study results suggest no difference in efficacy or tolerability between daptomycin 4 mg/kgIV QD and vancomycin or semisynthetic penicillins for complicated skin and skin-structure infections. Animal studies suggest daptomycin may be useful for the treatment of endocarditis. Daptomycin is not indicated for pneumonia, with poorer outcomes than conventional treatment It is available as an IV medication and exhibits 92% plasma protein binding in vitro. In healthy adult humans, daptomycin has a volume of distribution of 0.1 Ukg and a plasma elimination half-life of ∼9 hours, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion (∼54%). In patients with reduced renal function, including those receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the dose interval should be 48 hours. No dosage adjustment appears to be necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The use of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been assessed. The most commonly reported adverse events include constipation, nausea, injection-site reactions, headache, and diarrhea. Patients should also be monitored regularly for skeletal muscle toxicity. Conclusions: Daptomycin may be useful for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and gram-positive pathogens resistant to conventional antimicrobials. However, limited data are currently available for duration of treatment beyond 14 days and at doses >4 mg/kg QD.",2004-11-30,"Jeu, LilyAnn; Fung, Horatio B.",Clinical Therapeutics,,,True,custom_license

The antigenicity of the expression products was tested using a number of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies. The polyclonal antisera recognized different sets of epitopes in the 1162-residue sequence. The N-terminal region of one of the two subunits, S2, was recognized by all polyclonal sera and by two monoclonal antibodies. This clearly immunodominant region contains at least two adjacent or overlapping epitopes, one of which has been localized within 18 residues. The epitopes found as antigenic pEX expression products do not coincide with the regions in the S1 subunit that have been found to contain hypervariable sequences. We suggest that these regions constitute conformation dependent neutralization epitopes that cannot be detected in the pEX system.

Liver microcirculation has a unique design that allows very efficient exchange processes between plasma and liver cells, even when severe constraints are imposed upon the system, i.e. in stressful situations. Furthermore, it has been recognized recently that sinusoids and their associated cells can no longer be considered only as passive structures ensuring the dispersion of molecules in the liver, but represent a very sophisticated network that protects and regulates parenchymal cells through a variety of mediators. Finally, vascular abnormalities are a prominent feature of a number of liver pathological processes, including cirrhosis and liver cell necrosis whether induced by alcohol, ischemia, endotoxins, virus or chemicals. Although it is not clear whether vascular lesions can be the primary events that lead to hepatocyte injury, the main interest of these findings is that liver microcirculation could represent a potential target for drug action in these conditions.",1990-12-31,"Ballet, François",Pharmacology & Therapeutics,,,True,custom_license

The liver has emerged as the major organ participating in the degradation and elimination of arachidonate products of systemic origin. The synthesis in the liver of arachidonate products derived from the cfyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 system pathways has been demonstrated. The participation of leukotriene B4 and cysteinyl-leukotrienes as mediators of liver damage and the possible therapeutic usefulness of prostaglandins (PGs) in acute liver injury has attracted the interest of clinicians. This article reviews the essential features regarding the role of arachidonate metabolites in liver disease and specially focuses on the cytoprotective effects on the liver displayed by PGE2, PGE1, PGI2 and synthetic PG analogs in experimental models of liver damage induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury, carbon tetrachloride, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and viral hepatitis and on the possible mechanisms underlying liver cytoprotection in these experimental models.

There is now considerable data on the cells and factors involved in fetal resorption but little is known about the events which activate this process. While the activation of the maternal response to the fetal implant could have endogenous or genetic origins, a role for exogenous factors including microbial pathogens could also be involved. In order to investigate these possibilities, the reproductive success of CBA/j♀ × DBA/2j♂ matings in a conventional animal care facility were compared with matings in a specific pathogen free (SPF) animal facility. All animals housed under these conditions were routinely screened by immunoassay and culture, for the presence of a number of viral and bacterial pathogens of mice. The incidence of spontaneous embryo loss in specific pathogen free CBA female mice mated by DBA and other male strains was found to be virtually identical to that of CBA female mice infected with multiple viral pathogens and housed under otherwise identical conditions (non-SPF). However, the numbers of implantation per pregnancy was significantly greater in an SPF facility. Therefore, exposure of mating mice to exogenous viral and bacterial pathogens did not appear to alter the overall incidence of spontaneous embryo resorption. It was concluded that the immunomodulatory effects of infection by common murine pathogens neither augmented nor reduced post-implantation embryo losses.",1994-01-31,"Baines, M.G.; Billingsley, K.A.; De Fougerolles, A.R.; Duclos, A.J.; Olney, H.J.; Pomerantz, D.K.; Gendron, R.L.",Journal of Reproductive Immunology,,,True,custom_license

In addition, sera of VN-positive and VN-negative neonatal pigs were analyzed for immunoglobulin classes by radial immunodiffusion technique. The competence of neonatal pigs to produce VN antibody with increased IgG levels was demonstrated. The higher antibody response seen in neonatal pigs, when compared to sera of young adult pigs, may be attributed to the increased replication of TGEV in the intestinal tracts of neonatal pigs or to the lack of other immunogens that may interfere or compete with the production of specific antibody.",1982-09-30,"Stone, S.S.; Kemeny, L.J.; Jensen, M.T.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

Monoclonal antibodies to bovine immunoglobulin isotypes of proven specificity were used as conjugated or catching antibody. Five days after oral inoculation (dpi) of a 5-day-old gnotobiotic calf with rotavirus, IgM rotavirus antibodies were excreted in faeces, followed 5 days later by IgA rotavirus antibodies. The increase in IgM rotavirus antibody titre coincided with the inability to detect further rotavirus excretion. Faeces IgM and IgA rotavirus antibody titres fell to low levels within 3 weeks post infection. IgG1 and IgG2 rotavirus antibodies were not detected in faecal samples. In serum, antibodies to rotavirus of all four isotypes were detected, starting with IgM at 5 dpi. Two SPF-calves, which were fed colostrum free of rotavirus antibodies, were vaccinated with a modified live rotavirus vaccine and challenged with virulent rotavirus 6 days later. Upon vaccination, the calves showed an antibody response similar to the response of the infected gnotobiotic calf. Intestinal IgM rotavirus antibodies were excreted before or on the day of challenge and appeared to be associated with protection against challenge infection with virulent virus and rotavirus-induced diarrhoea. In 3 control calves, which were challenged only, the antibody patterns also resembled that of the gnotobiotic calf and again the appearance of IgM rotavirus antibodies coincided with the end of the rotavirus detection period. Two other groups of 3 SPF-calves were treated similarly, but the calves were fed colostrum with rotavirus antibodies during the first 48 h of life. These calves excreted passively acquired IgG1 and IgG2 rotavirus antibodies in their faeces from 2 to 6 days after birth. After vaccination, no IgM or IgA antibody activity in serum or faeces was detectable. Upon challenge, all calves developed diarrhoea and excreted rotavirus. Seven to 10 days after challenge low levels of IgM rotavirus antibody were detected for a short period. These data indicate that the intestinal antibody response of young calves to an enteric viral infection is associated with the excretion of IgM antibodies, immediately followed by IgA antibodies. This response is absent or diminished in calves with passively acquired specific antibodies which may explain the failure to induce a protective intestinal immune response by oral vaccination with modified live rotavirus of calves fed colostrum containing rotavirus antibodies.",1986-01-31,"Van Zaane, Dick; Ijzerman, Johan; De Leeuw, Peter W.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

Kittens vaccinated with envelope proteins and infected with feline sarcoma virus (FeSV) developed smaller tumors than nonvaccinates, but a greater incidence of persistent retroviremia. Similarly, FeLV-gp70 and -gp85 vaccinated kittens were more apt to become persistently retroviremic following virulent FeLV challenge exposure than nonvaccinates. Kittens vaccinated with inactivated whole FeLV developed smaller tumors after FeSV inoculation and had a lower incidence of persistent retroviremia than nonvaccinates. The protective effect of inactivated whole FeLV vaccine against persistent retroviremia was also seen with FeLV challenge-exposed cats. Protection afforded by inactivated whole FeLV vaccine was not associated with virus neutralizing antibodies, although ELISA antibodies to both whole FeLV and FeLV-gp70 were induced by vaccination.",1986-02-28,"Pedersen, N.C.; Johnson, L.; Birch, D.; Theilen, G.H.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

Selected members of a set of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific for each of four major isotypes of bovine Ig constant regions, one specific for anti-bovine Ig constant regions as well as one specific for anti-bovine light chains are discussed. Interspecific fusion of bovine lymphocytes with the established mouse cell line, SP2/0 was used to produce a collection of stable hybridomas among which were found secretors of bovine IgG1, IgG2, IgM, IgA and bovine light chain. Interspecific fusion of SP2/0 with lymphocytes from a multiparous Holstein four days post immunization with Streptococcus agalactiae yielded MAb with specificity for the immunizing antigen. One of these hybridomas, LHRB 19.17, which displayed a particularly stable secretory phenotype, was used as an immunogen for the production of a library of murine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies. Competitive antigen binding analysis showed that 15 of the 24 anti-LHRB 19.17 idiotype antibodies isolated blocked the binding of the idiotype to its nominal antigen and so were candidates for evaluation as antigen mimics.

Radiolabelled immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) anti-DNP antibody was administered to 2 day old calves by intravenous injection. The serum clearance rate was measured and was compared to the rate of protein-bound 125I excretion in the feces over a 10 day period to determine the importance of transfer to the gastrointestinal tract as a mechanism of serum IgG1 clearance. The amount of protein-bound and DNP-binding 125I present in the gastrointestinal tract of 10 day old calves at necropsy was also measured. Fecal excretion of protein-bound 125I accounted for 32% of the serum 125I-IgG1 clearance. Protein-bound 125I was present in the gastrointestinal tract at necropsy in amounts estimated to account for 68% of the total 125I-IgG1 clearance, and retained 65% of the DNP-binding ability of the original antibody. The discrepancy between the fecal excretion (32% of total IgG1 clearance) and the GI clearance estimated from protein-bound 125I in the gut (68% of total IgG1 clearance) is explained in part by IgG1 proteolysis occurring after transfer to the gastrointestinal tract but before fecal excretion. These results indicate that transfer to the calf gastrointestinal tract accounts for most IgG1 clearance in young calves, and that the intestinal antibody retains antigen binding function and may contribute to intestinal immunity.",1987-12-31,"Besser, T.E.; McGuire, T.C.; Gay, C.C.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

Shedding of virus in nasal or fecal samples, and virus-infected nasal epithelial cells were detected using immunofluorescent staining (IF), ELISA or immune electron microscopy (IEM). Isotype-specific antibody titers in sera, nasal and fecal samples were determined by ELISA. Calves inoculated with coronavirus shed virus in feces and virus was detected in nasal epithelial cells. Nasal shedding persisted longer in IN-inoculated calves than in O-inoculated calves and longer than fecal shedding in both IN and O-inoculated calves. Diarrhea occurred in all calves, but there were no signs of respiratory disease. Calves inoculated with rotavirus had similar patterns of diarrhea and fecal shedding, but generally of shorter duration than in coronavirus-inoculated calves. No nasal shedding of rotavirus was detected. Peak IgM antibody responess, in most calves, were detected in fecal and nasal speciments at 7–10 days post-exposure (DPE), preceeding peak IgA responses which occurred at 10–14 DPE. The nasal antibody responses occurred in all virus-inoculated calves even in the absence of nasal shedding of virus in rotavirus-inoculated calves. Calves inoculated with coronavirus had higher titers of IgM and IgA antibodies in fecal and nasal samples than rotavirus-inoculated calves. In most inoculated calves, maximal titers of IgM or IgA antibodies correlated with the cessation of fecal or nasal virus shedding. A similar sequence of appearance of IgM and IgA antibodies occurred in serum, but IgA antibodies persisted for a shorter period than in fecal or nasal samples.

Binding of the PBL to the PK-15 targets used in the single cell cytotoxicity assay for NK activity was not affected by age or by IFN treatment. When newborn piglets were treated with a single intravenous dose at 2 days of age of 0.5 mg/kg of polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid complexed with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC), a synthetic IFN inducer, their IFN levels peaked at 6 h post-induction, and NK activity in their PBL peaked at 24 h post-induction at the level normally found in weaned piglets. The NK activity then declined until 7 days post-induction, when it increased again in a similar manner to that in untreated control piglets. Target-binding of the PBL was not affected by poly ICLC treatment of the piglets. Newborn piglets treated with poly ICLC and subsequently exposed to infection with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus showed a delay in onset of clinical signs of TGE compared with untreated control piglets.

Four of the nine previously challenge-exposed cats were negative for virus-neutralizing antibodies against FIPV at the time of intradermal (ID) testing for DTH. Two other cats tested for DTH when acutely ill with clinical FIP did not have cutaneous DTH responses to FIPV. Gross skin reactions to FIPV injected ID were observed in six of nine asymptomatic cats (67%) at postintradermal inoculation hours (PIH) 24, 48, and/or 72. The reactions consisted of focal, 1–5-mm to 2.5-cm diameter indurated or semi-firm, nonerythematous, slightly raised nodules. Microscopically, DTH-like reactions were observed in biopsies taken from the FIPV-inoculated skin of asymptomatic cats at PIH 24 to 72. The lesions consisted of perivascular and diffuse dermal infiltrations by macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). The dermal infiltrates, which were maximal at PIH 48 or 72, were predominantly mixed inflammatory cells (five of nine cats) or PMN (four of nine cats) at PIH 24, but later were predominantly mononuclear cells (six of nine cats) or mixed inflammatory cells (two of nine cats) at PIH 72. Five of nine cats (56%) with positive DTH skin responses had increased survival times after lethal ID challenge-exposure with FIPV compared to mean survival times in FIPV-naive, non-immune control cats that were DTH-negative when ID challenge-exposed. Four of nine DTH-positive cats (44%) resisted an ID challenge-exposure dose of FIPV that was fatal in both control cats, and two of the four remaining DTH-positive cats survived a third challenge-exposure with highly lethal doses of FIPV given intraperitoneally. Four of the six DTH-positive cats (67%) that died after re-challenge and were necropsied had lesions of noneffusive FIP, suggesting that cellular immunity may also be involved in the pathogenesis of noneffusive disease, whereas both control cats and both DTH-negative cats with clinical disease succumbed to effusive FIP. Seemingly, DTH responses to FIPV can be associated with an increased level of resistance to disease; however, this state of immunity is variable and apparently can be lost with time in some cats.",1989-07-31,"Weiss, R.C.; Cox, N.R.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

Three-quarters of the cats with persistent FeLV infections died of non-neoplastic diseases and about 23% died of tumors, nearly exclusively those of the leukemia/lymphoma disease complex. A strong association with liver degeneration, icterus and a FeLV-associated enteritis was found in addition to the known association with non-neoplastic diseases and conditions such as anemia, bacterial secondary infections and respiratory tract inflammations due to the immunosuppressive effect of FeLV, hemorrhages and feline infectious peritonitis. Surprisingly, diseases and conditions like feline infectious panleukopenia, enteritis (of other types than FeLV-associated enteritis and feline infectious panleukopenia), glomerulonephritis, uremia and hemorrhagic cystitis were not associated with persistent FeLV infection. Another unexpected finding was that most pathogenic infectious agents demonstrated in the cats were not FeLV-associated either.

Pre-incubation of isolated feline peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in vitro with either 104 or 103 International Units (U) of rHuIFN-α for 24 h significantly suppressed (P<0.001 and 0.01, respectively) blastogenic responses to the phytomitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Lower doses of IFN (range, 10–10−3 U/ml) neither suppressed nor enhanced mitogenesis. In the absence of phytomitogens, incubation of PBL with 104–102 U (P<0.001) or 10 U (P<0.05) of rHuIFN-α/ml resulted in a significant decrease in incorporation of [methyl-3H] thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA. Cultures of PBL exposed continuously for 4 days to rHuIFN-α doses of 104 U/ml or less did not demonstrate specific reductions in cell viability, indicating that the observed antiproliferative actions of IFN apparently were independent of any direct cytotoxic effects. To investigate the dose-response effects of rHuIFN-α in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis, individual groups of cats were evaluated on 3 consecutive days before and then 24 h after each cat was inoculated intramuscularly with either a high dose (106 U/kg), moderate dose (104 U/kg), or a relatively low dose (102 U/kg) of rHuIFN-α. Cats inoculated with 106 U ofrHuIFN-α/kg had significantly reduced (P=0.037) blastogenic responses to Con a at 24 h postinoculation compared to preinoculation values; mean PWM responses were also decreased, but this effect was not statistically significant. In contrast, inoculation of cats with either 104 or 102 U of rHuIFN-α/kg significantly enhanced (P=0.05 or 0.008, respectively) Con A-induced blastogenesis and had no discernible effect on PWM responses. These findings suggest that very high doses of rHuIFN-α given parenterally may be associated with suppression of certain T-cell responses in cats; conversely, much lower doses may be immunoenhancing.",1990-02-28,"Weiss, R.C.; Oostrom-Ram, T.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

Selection of hybrid cell colonies was based on the ratio of bovine and murine chromosomes, the presence of cell-surface immunoglobulins and growth characteristics. First-generation fusion partners were compared for fusion efficiency and the number of antigen-specific antibody-producing clones generated. Hybrid cell colonies that initially secreted antibodies were selected from first-generation heteromyelomas to function as second-generation fusion partners. Although fusion efficiencies for both generations did not differ, the second-generation heteromyelomas yielded a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones. Fusion of heteromyelomas with either lymph node cells or splenocytes indicated that fusion with lymph node cells results in a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones, whereas fusion efficiency was found to be higher with splenocytes. The optimal time intervals between the final booster injection and fusion were found to be 4 days for splenocytes and 7 days for lymph node cells. Finally, the characterization of bovine monoclonal antibodies against bovine rotavirus and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin and their neutralizing capacities in vitro are described.",1990-03-31,"Booman, P.; Tieman, M.; Van Zaane, D.; Bosma, A.A.; De Boer, G.F.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

Both splenocytes and IELs from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were cytotoxic for LSCC-RP9, and the levels of this NK cell activity were not altered by infection of the host with rotavirus. IELs but not splenocytes from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were cytotoxic for rotavirus-infected but not for uninfected chick kidney cell targets. Because this cytotoxic activity was not induced nor altered by rotavirus infection of the host, and was not major histocompatibility complex-restricted, it was considered to be due to NK cell activity. The cytotoxicity of IELs against rotavirus-infected target cells was dose-dependent; however, there was some suppression of cytotoxic activity at high effector to target cell ratios. There were no differences in the cytotoxic activities of IELs collected from the duodenum versus the jejunum. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of IELs against rotavirus-infected target cells suggested that NK cell activity may be an important immune response to rotavirus infections in vivo. The absence of cytotoxic activity by splenocytes against rotavirus-infected target cells indicated that there may be different subpopulations of NK cells in the spleen and intestinal epithelium of chickens.",1990-10-31,"Myers, T.J.; Schat, K.A.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

To establish a foundation for evaluation of the immune function, cheetah peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were stimulated by a panel of six mitogens, and responses compared with those of domestic cat PBM. Individual responses in both species were variable, but evenly distributed throughout the range of stimulation for each mitogen. Proliferation by PBM from domestic cats occured within the same range as that of the cheetahs. However, a significantly lower response to peanut agglutinin (PNA) was observed with domestic cat PBM. Although responses varied between animals, certain individual cheetahs were consistent responders. The decreased values could not be explained by lack of IL-2 responsiveness since exogenous IL-2 significantly enhanced mitogen-stimulated proliferation in 11 of 12 cheetahs tested. The phenotypic distribution of domestic cat and cheetah lymphocyte subpopulations was similar as assessed by immunofluorescence staining for surface immunoglobulin (sIg) and cytotoxic T (Tc) cells (using a specific monoclonal antibody, FT2). Values for B cells (31.2% sIg+) and Tc (28.7% FT2 +) were slightly higher in domestic cats as compared with cheetah PBM (13.3% sIg+; 19.0% FT2+). Even though no species-specific deficits were detected, a significant negative correlation between PHA-stimulated proliferation and percent FT2+ (Tc) cheetah cells was observed. This indicates that proliferation can be used indirectly to assess relative numbers of functional T helper cells in cheetahs. Our studies suggest that these aspects of the cheetah's immune system are comparable with the domestic cat, and establish a basis for in vitro assays evaluating antigen-specific responses.",1991-07-31,"Miller-Edge, M.; Worley, M.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

Calves were then infected with a virulent rotavirus inoculum, J-160, to investigate the role of immune responses both in recovery from primary rotavirus infection and in resistance to secondary rotavirus infection. Treatment of calves with DX markedly suppressed in vitro responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens within 48 h of the start of DX treatment. Suppression was similar in rotavirus-naive and rotavirus-immune calves. In contrast, the effect of DX treatment on specific antibody responses differed depending on when DX treatment started in relation to rotavirus infection. When DX treatment commenced prior to primary rotavirus infection both systemic and local specific antibody responses were inhibited. These calves, in which mitogen and antibody responses were suppressed, exhibited greater clinical signs than did control calves after infection with virulent rotavirus, but virus excretion was affected in only one of the two calves. When DX treatment was started after primary rotavirus infection but before secondary infection, systemic and local antibody responses to the primary infection and to the challenge infection were not affected. These calves resisted challenge with virulent virus as did DX-untreated rotavirus-immune calves, even though mitogen responses were suppressed. We conclude that in a primary rotavirus infection, virus excretion ceased when both antibody and mitogen responses were suppressed. Resistance to secondary rotavirus infection occurred when mitogen responsiveness was suppressed, but when antibody levels were normal. Thus, no evidence was obtained that fully functional cell-mediated immune mechanisms are essential for resistance to rotavirus infection. Evidence was provided for the ability of parenteral treatment with DX to suppress mucosal as well as systemic antibody responses.",1992-04-30,"Oldham, G.; Bridger, J.C.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

Clinically all cats developed generalised lymphadenopathy, six cats were neutropenic and five cats lymphopenic. Three cats became febrile with conjunctivitis and anterior uveitis and one of these cats ultimately developed jaundice. Postmortem examinations confirmed a generalised lymphadenopathy involving peripheral and visceral lymph nodes with concurrent stimulation of splenic white matter and mucosal lymphoid tissue of the digestive tract and conjunctiva. Within the lymph nodes there was a reactive follicular hyperplasia accompanied by a paracortical hyperplasia with an increased paracortical vascularity. Unusual features were the presence of lymphoid follicles in the bone marrow, thymus and parathyroid tissue. In addition, aggregates of lymphoid cells were found within salivary glands, kidneys, sclera and choroid of the eye.

Responses to all three mitogens were suppressed to a similar degree. Analysis of the circulating mononuclear cell sub-populations before and during DM treatment demonstrated a selective depletion of B cells; the T lymphocyte sub-population that expresses the gamma/delta form of T cell receptor, are CD2−, CD5+, CD8−, CD4− and constitute a major population in peripheral blood of calves. In vitro studies in gnotobiotic and conventional calves confirmed that DM was highly inhibitory for PHA responses but, in contrast to the in vivo findings, showed little effect of DM on ConA responses. Expression of surface antigens after 72 h in vitro culture in the presence of DM were little affected with the exception of BoCD8 and MHC II, which showed increased and decreased expression, respectively.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were stimulated with two strains of UV-inactivated FHV-1, whole heat-killed organisms or capsular antigen of Cryptococcus neoformans, and proliferative responses measured. As a group, cheetah PBM responded significantly poorer than domestic cat PBM when cultured with FHV-1. However, individual cheetah responses varied widely. Supplementation of cultures with exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2) significantly increased the level of response of individual cheetahs to both strains of FHV-1. Cheetah sera contained slightly higher neutralizing antibody titers to FHV-1 than did domestic cat sera, suggesting that B cells function adequately in cheetahs. When stimulated with Cryptococcus neoformans, both species had similar incidences of positive proliferative responses. These data demonstrate that cheetahs exhibit heterogeneous responses to specific antigens, similar to domestic cats. However, a lower group response to FHV-1 in cheetahs suggests species differences occur. In addition, level of variability in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like genes, as determined by Southern blot hybridization, does not appear to correlate with a uniform response in in vitro functional assays.

Rotavirus-specific IgM ASC occurred by post-inoculation day (PID) 3, and numbers peaked in spleen and MLN tissues by PID 7 and in intestinal LP by PID 7–14. Numbers of rotavirus specific IgA and IgG ASC in these tissues peaked at PID 14–21. Rotavirus specific IgA ASC were predominant in the gut and IgA to IgG rotavirus specific ASC ratios were highest for all rotavirus antigen coatings in the gut LP. However, the relative ratios of specific IgA to IgG ASC were lower (ratios of 5 to 7) against combined structural and nonstructural viral antigens (rotavirus-infected fixed cell ELISPOT plates) than ratios (13 to 46) against only viral structural antigens (rotavirus-coated ELISPOT plates), indicating that there were proportionately more specific IgG ASC to the nonstructural viral antigens in the LP, the tissue adjacent to the site of rotavirus replication in the intestine. In the node cells (spleen and MLN) rotavirus-specific IgA to IgG ASC ratios were lowest and against the various ELISPOT rotavirus coatings ranged from 0.7 to 4. Gnotobiotic piglets inoculated at different ages with porcine rotaviruses generally showed similar specific immunoglobulin (Ig) ASC responses to rotavirus infection, along with similar diarrhea and virus shedding patterns in the different age groups. However, the numbers of specific IgA ASC in the MLN of 3–4 week old pigs were higher than those of 3–5 day old pigs. Although challenge of SB1A or Gottfried rotavirus-inoculated pigs with SB1A (G4P7) or Gottfried (G4P6) rotavirus revealed a high degree of protection from diarrhea and virus shedding, greater numbers of specific IgM ASC were observed in spleen after challenge of SB1A-inoculated pigs with Gottfried rotavirus (same G type, distinct P type). Thus, by using the ELISPOT technique, we successfully measured intestinal mucosal antibody-related responses to rotavirus in gnotobiotic pigs. Moreover, our results support the use of gnotobiotic piglets as an animal model to evaluate active antibody responses and protection against rotavirus infection and disease.",1995-04-30,"Chen, Wei-Kang; Campbell, Thomas; VanCott, John; Saif, Linda J.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

By contrast, 2.5 month later, a three-fold increase (P < 0.05) in IgG1 and IgA titres against HSF antigens was observed in calves fed HSF compared with those fed the control or HSPI diet. IgG1 immunoblotting revealed many protein bands from soya in the molecular range of 22–32 and 38–42 kDa. Immunorecognition of specific proteins from SMP and HSPI remained low and similar among animal groups. Specific IgM, IgA and IgG1 titres against HSF, and to a lesser extent HSPI, were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in jejunal mucous secretion of calves fed HSF compared with other groups. Secretions from calves fed HSF bound to many soyabean proteins in the range of 17–23 and 26–38 kDa, with similar patterns for IgA and IgG1. By contrast, only weak bands were found for IgM and IgG2 in all groups of calves. Thus, calves fed antigenic HSF do present specific Abs including IgG1 and IgA isotypes, both systemically and locally. Therefore, IgG1 and (or) IgA rather than IgM and IgG2 Abs may be preferred for assessing the immunogenicity of soyabean products in calves. Interestingly, soyabean immunogenicity was drastically reduced by adequate proteolysis.",1995-07-31,"Dréau, D.; Lallès, J.P.; Salmon, H.; Toullec, R.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

After reinfection and after reactivation, no BHV1-specific IgM antibody response was detected. The serum IgA response was only transiently detectable after reinfection and again appeared rapidly after reactivation in most calves. Most calves showed an increase in nasal and ocular IgA titres after reinfection and reactivation; some calves also had IgA antibodies in genital secretions. A salient finding was that after reinfection and reactivation more calves showed a serum IgA response than virus shedding or an increase in serum IgG1 or IgG2 titres. This suggests that the serum IgA response would be the most sensitive indicator to detect BHV1 reinfection and reactivation. No correlation was found between nasal IgA titre at the time of reinfection or corticosteroid treatment and the period of virus shedding, suggesting that nasal IgA does not play a major role in protection against reinfection with BHV1.",1995-07-31,"Madic, J.; Magdalena, J.; Quak, J.; van Oirschot, J.T.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

PRCV exposure induced partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases (42% vs. 90% in age-matched control pigs), limited virus shedding in feces, and increases in virus-neutralizing serum antibody titers; in contrast, all 11-day-old pigs inoculated with TGEV were completely protected after challenge. Weaned pigs were also studied to eliminate any possibility that lactogenic immunity from contact PRCV-exposed sows contributed to protection against TGEV. Once weaned, none of the PRCV-exposed or age-matched control pigs had diarrhea after TGEV challenge; moreover, both groups exhibited less rectal virus shedding than suckling pigs. Vigorous lymphocyte proliferative responses (> 96 000 counts per minute (cpm)) were detected in mononuclear cells prepared from mesenteric (MLN) and bronchial (BLN) lymph nodes of TGEV-primed pigs. Analyses of these responses indicate that virus-specific cell-mediated immune responses correlated with protection against rectal and nasal virus shedding after TGEV challenge. Primary inoculation of 11-day-old pigs with PRCV induced moderate, transient virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation (> 47 000 cpm) in MLN from both suckling and weaned pigs after TGEV challenge. Substantial BLN proliferative responses (> 80 000 cpm) correlated with failure to detect TGEV in nasal secretions from these pigs. Virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation in spleens was delayed in onset and of lower magnitude than that observed in MLN and BLN. Virulent TGEV exposure resulted in increased percentages of T cell subsets, especially in the lamina propria and MLN, mucosaassociated lymphoid tissues in proximity to the primary replication site of TGEV in the small intestine. Our results confirm that PRCV infection primes anti-viral immune responses and, thus, contributes to partial immunity against virulent TGEV challenge.",1995-09-30,"Brim, Theresa A.; VanCott, John L.; Lunney, Joan K.; Saif, Linda J.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

At the same time, in order to specify the effects of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) on the immune system, one half of the cats (n = 15) were previously infected with the Swiss isolate FIV Zurich 2. The second half of the animals (n = 15) served as non-infected controls. Eighteen (nine FIV-negative, nine FIV-positive) vaccinated and 12 (six FIV-negative, six FIV-positive) non-vaccinated cats were intraperitoneally challenged with FeLV A. Seventeen of 18 vaccinated cats were protected against persistent viremia, while ten of 12 non-vaccinated controls became infected. An increase of antibodies against FeLV SU was found in all protected cats after the challenge exposure. No difference in vaccine efficacy was found between FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals. The whole group of cats was observed for over 3 years. There were no further vaccinations during this period. CD4+ and CD8+ cell subsets, clinical outcome and time of survival of the cats were recorded. FIV-negative and FIV-positive animals were kept in two different rooms. However, FeLV-negative and FeLV viremic cats were housed together in both rooms in order to imitate a natural FeLV exposure situation. Anti-recombinant FeLV SU antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although a continuous decline of antibodies was found in FeLV vaccinated cats, they remained protected against constant FeLV challenge for over 3 years. FIV infection had a stronger effect on the depression of the CD4+:CD8+ ratio than FeLV infection. Within the group of FIV-positive cats, the FeLV-vaccinated animals had significantly better survival rates as well as better clinical and laboratory parameters. FIV- and FeLV-coinfected cats showed the lowest CD4+:CD8+ ratio, mainly caused by decreased CD4+ lymphocyte counts. CD8+ lymphocytes with strong fluorescence (CD8high) disappeared and cells with weak fluorescence (CD8low) appeared instead. Prevention of coinfection by immunizing FIV-positive cats against FeLV infection improved the clinical outcome and prolonged the cat's life expectancy.",1995-05-31,"Hofmann-Lehmann, R.; Holznagel, E.; Aubert, A.; Ossent, P.; Reinacher, M.; Lutz, H.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

The piglets were the offspring from 12 sires and 31 dams. Data from an earlier experiment, including 96 piglets of seven sires and 24 dams, were added when estimating heritabilities for Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The highest heritability (h 2=0.87±0.41) was estimated for the total number of PMNL. Medium high heritabilities (h 2=0.3−0.4) were estimated for the phagocytic capacity of PMNL, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production and the total number of WBC, while the heritability estimates were lower (h 2=0.00−0.08±0.12) for the total number of lymphocytes, serum concentrations of Ig and IFN-α production. Pronounced differences between litters from various dams were found for total number of lymphocytes, IFN-α production, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The Con A induced proliferation was positively correlated (r=0.48, P<0.001) with the IL-2 production and both these parameters were correlated (r=0.44 and 0.37, respectively, P<0.001) to the virus induced IFN-α production. Despite these positive correlations, no parental offspring group was uniformly superior across all traits measured.

Therefore, an experimental model was established to study the influence of elevated concentrations of circulating cortisol on the immune capacity in swine. Three experimental groups, with six pigs in each, were immunized twice, 4 weeks apart, with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen. Endogenous production of cortisol was induced by intramuscular injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) twice daily. One group received ACTH during the week before and after the second immunization, one group during the week after the second immunization only, while one group served as untreated controls. The treatment with ACTH induced high, but physiological, concentrations of cortisol in plasma. Simultaneously, the number of lymphocytes per milliliter blood decreased while the neutrophil number increased. The elevated concentrations of cortisol also coincided with reduced proliferation and interleukin-2 production by blood lymphocytes stimulated with the mitogens concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin in vitro, while the responses to pokeweed mitogen were less affected. The suppression of mitogen responses was more pronounced in cultures of whole blood than in cultures of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Antibody production, induced by M. hyopneumoniae in cultures of purified PBMC was also inhibited by ACTH treatment. Both the rate of increase and the magnitude of the antibody production induced by the primary immunization were reduced. In contrast, no effects of ACTH treatment were recorded for the response to the second immunization or on the serum levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae. The ability of blood leukocytes to produce interferon-α (IFN-α) at exposure in vitro to fixed pseudorabies virus adsorbed to porcine kidney cells increased in all animals shortly after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae. The influence of cortisol on the IFN-α-producing capacity was dependent on whether the test was carried out in whole blood cultures or in cultures with purified PBMC. This finding further emphasizes that the relevance of in vitro assays for measuring in vivo phenomena must be carefully scrutinized.",1994-09-30,"Wallgren, Per; Wilén, Inga-Lill; Fossum, Caroline",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

Humoral immune responses were assessed by enumerating specific antibody-secreting cells using ELISASPOT and by titrating immunoglobulins secreted into culture supernatants using ELISA techniques. Optimal secondary antibody response was observed from cultures performed with fetal calf serum (compared with horse serum) and with an antigen concentration of one to ten bacteria per cell. This kind of antigenic stimulation allowed induction of numerous antibody-secreting cells without adsorption of the secreted antibodies. Maximal numbers of antibody-secreting cells could reach a rate of 1% of the sheep leucocytes initially put into culture. Kinetic profiles of antibody production from boosted lymph node cells were characterized by an ascending phase from the sixth to the twelfth day of culture and then showed a plateau phase until Day 14. Most of the responses were composed of IgM and IgG1 antibodies, traces of IgG2 being detected at the end of experiments. From the twelfth day of antigenic stimulation, the IgM isotype was preferentially expressed with high antigen concentration (100 bacteria per cell), whereas the highest amounts of IgG1 were detected at lower concentration (one to ten bacteria per cell). While anti-Salmonella IgM appeared to be mainly specific for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cell wall fraction, some IgG1 recognized other bacterial antigens. Kinetic profiles and magnitudes of primary antibody responses induced in vitro from lamb lymph node cells did not differ from those defined in cultures of sheep boosted leucocytes. But these immune reactions were mainly made up of anti-LPS IgM. Few anti-Salmonella IgG1 were detected from the tenth day of culture. So these in vitro assays allowed induction of an antibody synthesis from either in vivo sensitized or unprimed sheep lymph node leucocytes. This methodology would permit achievement of more detailed studies on interactions between Salmonella and lymph node leucocytes, leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling bacterial dissemination through the lymphoid tissue.",1994-06-30,"Berthon, P.; Gohin, I.; Lantier, I.; Olivier, M.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

The initial concept of an enteromammary immunologic axis in monogastrics originated from studies of lactogenic immunity to TGEV in swine. These studies revealed that infection of pregnant swine with virulent TGEV stimulated high titers of SIgA antibodies in milk which correlated with protection of suckling pigs against TGE; parenteral or oral inoculation with live attenuated or killed TGEV vaccines induced mainly IgG antibodies in milk which generally provided poor protection to suckling pigs. The recent appearance of PRCV infections in swine and continuing studies of TGEV infections, present a unique model for further studies of mucosal immunity. Research using these viruses has increased our understanding of the various components of the common mucosal immune system and their interactions. Although the most important consideration in designing an effective vaccine for TGEV is the stimulation of GALT through intestinal virus replication, studies addressing the contribution of BALT to immunity to TGEV and PRCV may provide insights for alternative vaccine approaches. The mechanism by which exposure to PRCV elicits a variable degree of immunity to TGEV challenge is unknown. Virus replication in the gut or respiratory tract is a major factor affecting the magnitude of the immune response at the respective site and may be necessary for the recruitment of specific immune cells from other mucosal inductive sites, i.e., GALT to BALT and BALT to GALT migration. Further studies on the induction and immune regulation of specific responses to TGEV and PRCV that affect the distribution patterns of IgM-, IgG- and IgA-antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and T lymphocytes should provide valuable insights for optimizing vaccine regimens to elicit the highest mucosal immune responses and optimal protection against TGEV challenge.",1994-10-31,"Saif, L.J.; van Cott, J.L.; Brim, T.A.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

In order to determine the effects of multiple vaccination schedules on the immune system of racing greyhounds, three litters of greyhound pups raised in laboratory conditions were divided into two groups and subjected to either a maximum or a minimum vaccination schedule. Blood samples were collected biweekly for 6 months beginning at 2 weeks of age and analyzed to establish ‘baseline’ values for the lymphatic system of greyhounds.

Humoral immunity was evaluated using serum neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests. Proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) was higher for the maximum vaccination groups. The frequency distribution of circulating CD4 and IgG labeled lymphocytes was higher in the minimum vaccination groups. A significant treatment by time interaction in CD4, IgG, and IgM labeled cells was observed. This interaction, however, was not significant at any point in time for CD4 and IgG labeled cells. The percentage of lymphocytes expressing surface IgM was significantly higher in the minimum vaccination groups at 10 and 14 weeks of age. No significant differences were detected in humoral immunity between the maximum and minimum groups of each litter.

The acute phase response is comprised of reactions localized at the site of infection, as well as the initiation of systemic responses, which include a rapid increase in the serum concentration of some proteins, known as acute phase proteins (APP). Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we detected two APP of approximately 22 and 37 kDa molecular weight in sera obtained from cattle with bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Based on their presence in the sera of sick, but not normal animals, the molecular weights, N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, and the ability to bind hemoglobin, we identified these proteins as the α and β subunits of haptoglobin. The haptoglobin molecule and the α subunit were isolated from serum, purified, and used to produce monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. With these reagents, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was developed to measure the concentration of haptoglobin in bovine serum. Using an experimental model of BRD induced by a sequential challenge of calves with bovine herpesvirus type-1 and Pasteurella haemolytica, we observed a temporal relationship between the increase in haptoglobin concentration in serum and the onset of bacterial infection. The haptoglobin concentration ranged from undetectable in the serum of most calves prior to challenge, to greater than 1 mgml−1 in over one-third of the calves at the height of disease. Furthermore, the concentration of haptoglobin was associated significantly with other measures of the severity of disease. Together, these results indicate that quantification of acute phase proteins in animals with BRD could be a valuable diagnostic and prognostic aid.",1996-06-01,"Godson, Dale L.; Campos, Manuel; Attah-Poku, Samuel K.; Redmond, Mark J.; Cordeiro, Daphne M.; Sethi, Manjeet S.; Harland, Richard J.; Babiuk, Lorne A.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

Possible antiviral mechanisms of macrophages are defined and referred to as intrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to serve as a non-permissive barrier between the virus and susceptible cells and extrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to affect the virus or virus replication in surrounding cells. Most studies on the role of macrophages in natural resistance to virus infections have been performed in animal models. An interesting aspect of many viral infections in animals is the finding of a genetically determined variation in natural resistance. Because of the availability of numerous inbred and congenic strains most studies on genetically determined resistance have been performed in mice. The classical examples are resistance to flaviviruses and susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus, both of which are inherited as dominant, monogenic traits. With these viruses macrophage intrinsic restriction of virus replication has been found to express at the cellular level the genetics of resistance/susceptibility seen in the intact animal. Other examples, where macrophages have been implicated in genetically determined resistance include herpes simplex virus and influenza virus. The involvement of macrophages in natural resistance to these viruses is discussed in relation to other putative resistance determinants like interferon production and sensitivity and natural killer cell activity.",1985-12-31,"Mogensen, Søren C.",Immunology Letters,,,True,custom_license

T cells of peripheral blood and serous body fluids are CD13-negative but can be stimulated to express CD13 after activation, e.g., with Con A. In the present report, double-labelling and flow cytometry analyses were performed to characterize the phenotype of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). A large panel of antibodies specific for different activation-associated molecules on T cells was used. In contrast to TIL of lung cancer, TIL of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) consisted of significantly higher percentages of T cells expressing CD13, dipeptidylpeptidase N (DPIV, CD26) and HLA-DR, whereas T cells of lung cancer expressed more CD25, CD69 and CD54/ICAM1.

Cells were induced to produce IFN-α by incubation with the coronavirus TGEV and IFN-α SC were detected by ELISPOT. A striking finding was that IFN-α SC could be detected in the fetal liver as early as at 26 days of gestation, i.e., during the first quarter of gestation, a period at which T-cell markers could not be detected by flow cytometry. In addition, IFN-α SC could be detected in the cord blood, the spleen and the bone marrow of fetuses at later stages of gestation. These data indicate that IFN-α SC appear very early during the ontogeny of the immune system, long before the development of the specific immune system, and may therefore represent an early antiviral defence mechanism. IFN-α SC were found to be associated with hematopoietic organs, which argues for their hematopoietic lineage.",1994-12-31,"Šplíchal, Igor; Bonnneau, Michel; Charley, Bernard",Immunology Letters,,,False,custom_license

This mutant has a genetic defect in copper metabolism and spontaneous neuronal degeneration develops around postnatal day 10, in particular in the parasagittal regions of the cerebral cortex and thalamus. The antibodies to macrophage specific antigen, F4/80 and to type-three complement receptor, Mac-1 were used for the study. Reactive morphological changes of microglia, which are immuno-reactive to the antibodies to F4/80 and/or Mac-1, were demonstrated in areas corresponding to those of neuronal degeneration, coincident with the emergence of cells expressing major histocompatibility complex class II, Ia, antigen. Some of the Ia expressing cells had morphological features of ramified microglia, while others were rod shaped with few processes and were mostly located in the perivascular regions. The focal nature of such cellular changes suggests that signal(s) from the degenerating neurons may be responsible for microglial activation and cellular expression of the Ia antigen in the brain of the brindled mouse.",1992-05-22,"Ohno, Masaki; Higashi, Yasuto; Suzuki, Kinuko",Developmental Brain Research,,,True,custom_license

In this review, genes associated with the tumor phenotype have been arranged on the human gene map and indicate the extent to which the tumor phenotype involves the human genome. Nonrandom chromosomal aberrations that are frequently observed in tumors are presented. Altered metabolic demands of the tumor cell are reflected in altered gene expressions of a wide range of enzymes and other proteins, and these changed enzyme patterns are described. The study of oncogenes increasingly suggests that they may be significant in certain cancers, and the assignment of these genes has been tabulated. The biochemical and metabolic changes observed in tumors are complex; studying the patterns and interactions of these changes will aid our genetic understanding of the origins and development of tumors.",1983-11-30,"Honey, Neville K.; Shows, Thomas B.",Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics,,,True,custom_license

Many rats survived this infection and recovered completely from this CNS disease. Among 43 survivors of SDE, 9 rats developed a relapse 27–153 days after onset of the first attack. Neuropathological examination of these animals revealed areas of fresh demyelination together with old remyelinated lesions. Viral antigens were detectable in the neighbourhood of fresh lesions and in some cases infectious virus was re-isolated from rats revealing low antibody titers to JHM virus.

JHM virus, LPS and AP are all capable of inducing Ia molecules on astrocytes, however, in a pattern and kinetics distinct from recombinant rat gamma interferon (γ-IFN). Whereas γ-IFN induced Ia expression on astrocytes and all macrophages after 48 h treatment, JHM virus, LPS and AP required 4–7 days for maximal induction of Ia on astrocytes, but had little to no effect on the macrophage population. This indicates that astrocytes are uniquely reactive to components derived from infectious agents and that these components are immunoregulatory with respect to Ia expression on astrocytes. We have also attempted to determine possible mechanisms by which these agents induce astrocyte Ia and show that phorbol myristate acetate and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 have similar effects. These findings suggest that infectious agents may directly stimulate antigen presenting functions of astrocytes in the brain through γ-IFN-independent mechanisms.",1987-01-31,"Massa, Paul T.; Meulen, Volker ter",Journal of Neuroimmunology,,,True,custom_license

Transient DTH response to nonviral antigens induced an accumulation of monocytes in the CNS that was maximal at 48 h post-challenge and virtually resolved by 5 days post-challenge. By contrast the induction of prolonged DTH responses resulted in the accumulation of a large number monocytes that persisted in the CNS for at least 5 days post-challenge.

The disease is characterized pathologically by an intense inflammatory infiltration within both the white and grey matter of the central nervous system (CNS) without apparent demyelination. Both during and after SAME splenic lymphocytes from these animals could be restimulated in vitro to proliferate in the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP). MBP-specific class II MHC-restricted T cell lines were isolated from this cell population. They were shown to exhibit no cross-reactivity with measles virus and to induce experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) in naive syngeneic recipients following adoptive transfer. The clinical and histopathological signs of this T cell-mediated disease were identical to that seen in classical T cell-mediated EAE. A humoral immune response to MBP was only detected in a limited number of those rats with SAME.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), however, as in endocrine autoimmune diseases, there is a marked increase of HLA expression in the tissue (i.e. the plaques) and this is attributable not only to infiltrating cells but also to the astrocytes. To gain an insight into the regulation of HLA in the different cell types in the CNS and to compare it to that observed in the endocrine organs, we have studied the effect of the lympho/monokines interferon (IFN)-α and -γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-2 and other agents on this aspect of the biology of human fetal brain cells in culture. A two-colour immunofluorescence technique which combines antibodies to diverse CNS cell markers and monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to the non-polymorphic region of HLA molecules was used throughout this study. In control cultures, only astrocytes expressed MHC class I, but after incubation with either IFN-γ or TNF-α oligodendrocytes acquired class I expression. Surprisingly, astrocytes became spontaneously class II positive in culture and this was greatly enhanced by IFN-γ. Other agents such as IL-2, epidermal growth factor, phorbolmyristate acetate and lectins had no effect. The expression of HLA molecules in the cells of the CNS both in basal conditions and in response to lymphokines is therefore selective and highly heterogenous, thus reflecting their intrinsic biological diversity. These findings may help to explain the features of the immunopathology of MS and also of latent viral infections of neural cells.",1988-07-31,"Mauerhoff, Thekla; Pujol-Borrell, Ricardo; Mirakian, Rita; Bottazzo, Gian Franco",Journal of Neuroimmunology,,,True,custom_license

These areas, which lack a blood-brain barrier, correspond to those showing early invasion of trypanosomes. In addition, there was a marked induction of MHC class I in neurons in two hypothalamic nuclei, The paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Neurons in these two nuclei are located behind the blood-brain, but project to the neurohypophysis and to the medain eminence, thereby exposing their axon terminals to factors circulating in the blod or released locally from invading trypanosomes or from macrophages or cytotoxic T-cells.

Inducible expression, either as a consequence of cultivation or standard γ-interferon treatment, differed markedly among the strains examined. Analysis of congenic strains on a C57BL/10 (B10) background showed that expression was controlled by genes within the MHC locus. Examination of additional congeneic animals with various recombinations within the MHC showed that high or low expression of MHC molecules correlates with the presence of particular MHC class I genes. In general, H-2a and H-2d class I products are expressed much higher on astrocytes than H-2b and H-2s products.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) can act synergistically with IFN-γ with respect to class II expression on a variety of cells. As brain cells themselves can secrete TNF-like factors upon stimulation, we examined the effect of TNF-α on IFN-γ-mediated class II induction on astrocytes. TNF-α alone had no effect on class II expression, but did synergize with IFN-γ for enhanced expression of class II antigens. The specificity of TNF-α activity was demonstrated by blocking the amplifying effect of TNF-α with a polyclonal anti-TNF-α antibody. Kinetic analysis of the synergistic effect indicated that optimal TNF-α enhancement of class II expression was observed when astrocytes were pretreated with IFN-γ 12–24 h prior to TNF-α addition. A possible mechanism for the synergistic action between IFN-γ and TNF-α may be increased TNF-α receptor expression by IFN-γ. Astrocytes treated with IFN-γ for 24 h express more TNF-α receptors (3900/cell) than do untreated astrocytes (2483/cell), with no significant change in the binding affinity (K d). These results suggest that the synergistic activity of TNF-α requires an inductive signal from IFN-γ, which in part may be increased TNF-α receptor expression. Altogether, our observations indicate that TNF-α enhances ongoing class II major histocompatibility complex gene expression in rat astrocytes, which in this system is initially induced by IFN-γ. TNF-α exerts its effect by binding to high affinity TNF-α receptors on astrocytes, whose expression is also enhanced by IFN-γ. These two cytokines work in concert to elevate class II expression on astrocytes, an event which can contribute to initiation and/or perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.",1989-12-31,"Benveniste, Etty N.; Sparacio, Shaun M.; Bethea, John R.",Journal of Neuroimmunology,,,True,custom_license

Previous data from this laboratory had shown that the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) enhances IFN-γ-mediated class II antigen expression on astrocytes. We have now investigated the effect of IFN-γ and TNF-α on class II MHC mRNA expression in astrocytes using Northern blot analysis. Astrocytes do not constitutively express mRNA for class II MHC. Kinetic analysis of class II MHC mRNA expression in IFN-γ-treated cells demonstrated an 8 h time lag, which was followed by an increase over the next 16 h. Optimal expression of class II mRNA was detected after a 24 h incubation with IFN-γ. This level of expression was further enhanced by the simultaneous addition of IFN-γ and TNF-α to the astrocytes, while TNF-α alone had no effect on class II mRNA expression. TNF-α does not act by increasing the stability of IFN-γ-induced class II mRNA, indicating its action is not at that specific level of post-transcriptional control. Furthermore, astrocyte class II mRNA expression was inhibited when cycloheximide (CHX) was added together with IFN-γ or IFN-γ/TNF-α, and when CHX was added up to 4 h after treatment with IFN-γ or IFN-γ/TNF-α. These results indicate that astrocyte class II mRNA expression is mediated by newly synthesized proteins induced by IFN-γ and/or IFN-γ/TNF-α.

Failure of neuroantigen-specific immune tolerance to affect the clinical course of demyelination,10.1016/0165-5728(90)90115-4,,1688446.0,els-covid,"Abstract Intracerebral inoculation of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) into susceptible mouse strains produces a chronic demyelinating disease in which mononuclear cell-rich infiltrates in the central nervous system (CNS) are prominent. Current evidence strongly supports an immune-mediated basis for myelin breakdown, with an effector role proposed for TMEV-specific, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in which lymphokine-activated macrophages mediate bystander demyelination. The present study examined the possibility that concomitant or later-appearing neuroantigen-specific autoimmune T cell responses, such as those demonstrated in chronic-relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (R-EAE), may contribute to the demyelinating process following TMEV infection. T cell responses against intact, purified major myelin proteins (myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP), and against altered myelin constituents were readily demonstrable in SJL/J mice with R-EAE, but were not detectable in SJL/J mice with TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. TMEV-infected mice also did not display T cell responses against the peptide fragments of MBP(91–104) and PLP(139–151) recently shown to be encephalitogenic in SJL/J mice. In addition, induction of neuroantigen-specific tolerance to a heterogeneous mixture of CNS antigens, via the i.v. injection of syngeneic SJL/J splenocytes covalently coupled with mouse spinal cord homogenate, resulted in significant suppression of clinical and histologic signs of R-EAE and the accompanying MBP- and PLP-specific DTH responses.

We report here additional studies to characterize this reaction. The effector lymphocytes in the cytotoxic reaction are also encephalitogenic as evidenced by the capacity of other aliquots of these cells to transfer experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). We confirmed that the presence of both MBP and antigen-presenting cells (APC) are required for this in vitro cytotoxic effect. This reaction (measured by 51Cr release from labeled oligos) is dose-dependent on the effector/target ratio with marked 51Cr release at a 20/1 ratio. Effector/target cell contact is required since: (a) 51Cr release is not significantly increased when effector Lc and oligo are separated by a micropore membrane (28% vs. 24% spontaneous release); (b) no cytotoxic activity is present in the supernatant fluid of a toxic reaction. The adhesion of 51Cr-labeled effector Lc to unlabeled oligo is increased in the presence of both MBP and APC (21 ± 1.0% of cell adhering) as compared with effector Lc + APC (12 ± 2.7%), or effector Lc alone (14 ± 2.8%). Surface expression of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens was expressed on the surface of the target oligos during this in vitro cytotoxic reaction. This may explain our previously observed MHC restriction in this reaction. The findings described here may explain some of the in vivo pathogenic events in EAE.",1990-01-31,"Kawai, Kuniyuki; Zweiman, Burton",Journal of Neuroimmunology,,,True,custom_license

MBP-selected CD44+ T cell lines both from measles-infected animals as well as from rats challenged with guinea pig MBP (Gp-MBP) had a similar pattern of response in the presence of synthetic peptides to Gp-MBP and specifically responded in vitro only to the encephalitogenic and not the non-encephalitogenic or other control peptides. In primary splenic lymphocyte cultures from SAME animals, however, a low but significant T-cell response was obtained against the non-encephalitogenic peptide S67 (residues 69–81) of the Gp-MBP. Moreover, immunization of MV-infected rats with this peptide induced clinical and histological experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in 38% of the animals. The results of the study show that the non-encephalitogenic peptide S67 can be rendered encephalitogenic in rats when an additional stimulus is given in the form of MV infection.

Although immune mechanisms operate in many disease processes of the central nervous system (CNS), cells of the CNS generally express low levels of HLA molecules. In this study, the potential for upregulation of HLA molecules on adult human glial cells was examined. Moreover, the functional implication of this upregulation was assessed by the capacity of glial cells to process and present target antigens to HLA class I-restricted influenza-specific and class II-restrict myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific CTL lines. Glial cells cultured from adult human surgical brain specimens or cells from established glioblastoma multiforme cell lines were studied. Lysis by antigen-specific CTLs was dependent on treatment of the target cell with interferon-γ. The lysis was HLA restricted and antigen specific. The results indicate that adult human glial cells can process and present antigen to HLA-restricted CTLs but require the upregulation of HLA molecules.

Other cytokines released during an inflammatory process can potentially influence MHC expression as well. One cytokine of interest is interleukin-1 (IL-1), an immunoregulatory polypeptide that is produced by macrophages and also by cells in the CNS. In this study, the effedt of IL-1β on MHC expression in a human glioblastoma multiforme cell line, U-105 MG, has been examined. Treatment of U-105 MG with 10 U IL-1β/ml for a period of 5 days resulted in a decrease in constitutive cell surface HLA class II expression and limited the induction of class II by IFN-γ. This effect was also observed on steady-state levels of class II RNA and could be neutralized with antibodies to IL-1β. All class II transcripts examined (HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP α and β) were affected. Class I expression was only marginally changed by IL-1β treatment. A minimal concentration of 1 U IL-1β/ml was required to reduce class II expression and a kinetics experiment indicated that U-105MG must be treated for at least 4 days with IL-1β for a decrease in class II expression to be observed. This study suggests that IL-1 may play a role in limiting immunoreactivity in the CNS by limiting class II induction.",1991-07-31,"Cowan, Elliot P.; Pierce, Michael L.; Dhib-Jalbut, Suhayl",Journal of Neuroimmunology,,,True,custom_license

We have developed a binding assay for 125I-labeled recombinant murine IFN-γ, and show that, using this assay, IFN-γ interacts with a single specific receptor on the murine astrocyte cell membrane. The binding is specific and saturable and it takes place with a K d = 1.64 × 10−9 M, with 11,100 receptor molecules per astrocytic cell. The binding shows, as for macrophages, species specificity. Using an immune assay including rabbit antibodies to IFN-γ and 125I-labeled protein A, we have demonstrated an internalization of the ligand.

By contrast, CTL specific for influenza virus (FLU) and mumps virus is normal. It is uncertain if reduced CTL is limited to MV in MS patients, or if reduced CTL may be found to other viruses as well. Since MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules, while FLU-specific and mumps-specific CTL have large HLA class I-restricted components, reduced MV-specific CTL may reflect a broader reduction in HLA class II-restricted CTL in patients with MS. To examine this question we studied the generation of CTL specific for herpes simplex virus type I (HSV). HSV-specific CTL, like MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules. We found that patients with MS had reduced generation of CTL to both MV and HSV. Most, but not all patients who had reduced generation of CTL to one virus also had a similar impairment with respect to the second virus. Some patients, however, had a reduction in the generation of CTL only to MV or to HSV. These findings extend our earlier observations regarding reduced MV-specific CTL in patients with MS to a second HLA class II-restricted virus, HSV. Such a reduction may reflect discrete impairments in immune function to separate viruses, possibly those that are associated with viral persistence, or may reflect a more generalized defect in HLA class II-restricted CTL.",1991-12-31,"de Silva, Shari M.; McFarland, Henry F.",Journal of Neuroimmunology,,,True,custom_license

When Sindbis virus (SV) is injected intracerebrally into weanling mice it causes an acute non-fatal encephalitis and recovery is primarily dependent on the development of antiviral antibody. We used a modified enzyme-linked immunoassay to determine the number of antibody-secreting cells (ASC) specific for SV and their Ig isotype in brain, spleen and cervical lymph nodes over the course of the acute encephalitis. The numbers of SV-specific ASC peak early in spleen and lymph nodes and then begin to increase in brain, suggesting that initial stimulation of B cells occurs primarily in peripheral lymphoid tissue followed by B cell entry into the circulation and appearance in the brain. The pattern for each individual isotype was similar with peak numbers of SV-specific cells present in the spleen 5–7 days after infection, while numbers in the brain continue to rise through day 20 when most ASC were secreting IgG2a or IgA SV-specific antibody. The data suggest therefore that most isotype switching from IgM to IgG and IgA occurs in peripheral lymphoid tissue. An exception to this pattern is IgG1, where numbers of ASC producing IgG1 do not show a peak in spleen and continue to rise in brain through the course of acute encephalitis. The data also indicate that early in infection a large proportion of ASC in the brain are not specific for SV and demonstrate that recruitment of ASC into the CNS is non-specific. However, the percentage of ASC that are specific for SV structural proteins rises steadi throughout the course of encephalitis suggesting that retention of ASC in the CNS is specific or that some portion of the SV-specific antibody response is generated within the CNS.",1993-10-31,"Tyor, William R.; Griffin, Diane E.",Journal of Neuroimmunology,,,True,custom_license

Since remyelination is a prominent feature in MS lesions, we examined the frequencies of T cell lines (TCLs) specific for epitopes within exon 2 encoded MBP (X2MBP), and also within 18.5-kDa MBP, in members of a multiplex family with MS. TCLs specific for X2MBP were as prevalent as TCLs specific for immunodominant epitopes within 18.5-kDa MBP.

Since IL-4 exhibits a variety of functions on the cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage, we examined the effects of IL-4on the functions of microglia. Recombinant IL-4 induced the proliferation of microglia in a dose- and time-dependent manner as determined by MTT colorimetric assay, [3H]thymidine uptake and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. IL-4 also synergistically enhanced the proliferation of microglia with such colony-stimulating factors as IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). It also increased acid phosphatase activity and superoxide anion formation by these cells. Despite these positive effects on proliferation and activation, IL-4 suppressed the IFN γ-induced class II MHC antigen expression in these cells. Since these effects of recombinant IL-4 inhibited by the addition of monoclonal antibody against IL-4 receptors, the effects of IL-4 on microglia appear to be a specific function via IL-4 receptors. Although microglia and astrocytes produce a variety of immunoregulatory cytokines, neither cell produced IL-4 as determined by bioassay or detection of IL-4 mRNA by RT-PCR method. Thus, the exogenous IL-4 may contribute to the accumulation of microglia in or around inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system, and may be involved in the regulatory mechanisms of microglia.",1994-09-30,"Suzumura, Akio; Sawada, Makoto; Itoh, Yasuhiro; Marunouchi, Tohru",Journal of Neuroimmunology,,,True,custom_license

The majority of CD4+ T lymphocytes entering the virus-infected CNS in the course of the infection are primed cells that neither proliferate ex vivo nor can be stimulated to proliferation by viral antigens or mitogen in vitro. In contrast, T lymphocytes taken from CLNs of the same animals revealed a strong proliferative response. Restimulation of CLN lymphocytes by viral antigens disclosed a striking difference between the disease-resistant rat strain Brown Norway (BN) and the susceptible Lewis (LEW) strain. Whereas BN lymphocytes responded as early as 5 days post infection, it took more than 11 days until a comparable proliferation was detectable in LEW lymphocytes. From these data we postulate that the majority of T lymphocytes entering the virus-infected brain after sensitisation and expansion in cervical lymph nodes is unresponsive to further proliferation signals and that the kinetics and magnitude of T lymphocyte stimulation in CLNs play an important role in the clinical course of the infection.",1994-08-31,"Imrich, H.; Schwender, S.; Hein, A.; Dörries, R.",Journal of Neuroimmunology,,,True,custom_license

Previously, immunological studies in MS had almost exclusively used the more abundant 18.5 kDa isoform of MBP, which does not does not contain the exon 2 peptide. Investigations of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) have also focussed on the 18.5 kDa MBP isoform and its peptides. Since EAE is an animal model widely used widly used to study MS, we examined the encephalitogenic potential of exon 2 peptide in the SJL/J mouse. Evidence for increased expression of exon 2-containing isoforms during remyelination in mouse CNS suggested that exon 2-sensitized T cels, with encephalitogenic capacity, might be important in the pertuation of relapsing EAE (rEAE). Our experiments have demonstrated that exon 2 peptide is inherently immunogenic in SJL mice and that EAE could be induced by the adoptive transfer of exon 2-sensitized lymphocytes. Furthermore, the disease could be accentuated by the transfer of short-term exon 2-reactive lines or by a combination of adoptive transfer and antigenic challenge with exon 2 peptide.

With use of an RNase protection assay, we observed a selective inhibition of IFN-γ and IL-6 gene transcription in brains of mice infected with HSV-2. It is likely that the inhibition of cytokine gene expression was mediated through a failure to activate CD4+ lymphocytes.

Irradiation which is necessary for EAE induction caused a decrease in the total number of lymphocytes and an increase in CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in the spleen of BALB/c mice. EAE induction increased the ratio further until clinical and histological signs of EAE appeared. Entry of perivascular CD4+ and CD8+ cells preceded the onset of clinical signs and the appearance of MAC-1+ cells in the central nervous system (CNS). In the acute phase of EAE, cellular infiltrates, which were sparse, consisted mainly of MAC-1+ cells and a few CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Inflammatory cells gradually disappeared during the recovery phase. SFV-A7 infection after irradiation and EAE induction did not significantly change the CD4+/CD8+ ratio in the spleen or in the CNS infiltrates but enhanced the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. Similar perivascular cell influx was also seen in untreated mice infected with SFV-A7. We conclude that observed rapid reduction of splenic mononuclear cells and increase of the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio caused by irradiation prior EAE induction are early crucial events in disease induction in this resistant strain of mice. SFV-A7 infection, which further facilitates the development of EAE, does not induce immunoregulatory changes but provides its effect by enhancing the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. The combination of these two mechanisms thus effectively breaks the natural resistance against EAE in this genetically resistant mouse strain.",1994-11-30,"Erälinna, J.P.; Soilu-Hänninen, M.; Röyttä, M.; Ilonen, J.; Mäkelä, M.; Salmi, A.; Salonen, R.",Journal of Neuroimmunology,,,True,custom_license

FACS analysis of explant astrocyte cultures from established transgenic lines demonstrated astroglial expression of the GFAP-Db fusion gene at the protein level.

To determine the cellular mechanism of resistance and interferon (IFN)-γ-producing cell populations, mononuclear cells isolated from tissues of the brain were analyzed by the flow cytometry method. Antibodies specific for CD3, CD4, CD8, T cell receptor (TCR)-αβ, and Asialo GM1 were used to deplete the corresponding cell populations in Theiler's virus-infected mice. CD4+ lymphocytes and CD8+ lymphocytes infiltrated in the brains of infected mice from 5 days postinfection (p.i.). The number of CD3+/TCR-γδ+ lymphocytes increased in the brains on Day 6 p.i. The elimination of CD3+ lymphocytes or CD4+ lymphocytes augmented viral replication and suppressed the production of IFN-γ. The suppression of IFN-γ production by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) persisted, although the suppression by anti-CD4 mAb was observed only on Day 6 p.i. The depletion of CD8+ lymphocytes as well as TCR-αβ+ lymphocytes also augmented the viral replication; however, it did not alter the production of IFN-γ. Anti-Asialo GM1 antibody had no effect on viral replication and IFN-γ production. These results indicate that T lymphocytes are important for eliminating Theiler's virus from the brain, CD3+/CD4+/CD8− lymphocytes and CD3+/TCRαβ−/CD4−/CD8− lymphocytes would produce IFN-γ in brain. However, from the result on the experiment of the depletion of TCR-αβ+ lymphocytes, the defence mechanisms by T lymphocytes against Theiler's virus would be independent of endogenous IFN-γ production.",1994-06-30,"Kohanawa, Masashi; Nakane, Akio; Asano, Misako; Minagawa, Tomonori",Journal of Neuroimmunology,,,True,custom_license

These surface molecules associated with immune function were either induced (Class II) or upregulated (Class I and ICAM-1) on cultured retinal glial cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner following exposure to recombinant Interferonγ (rIFN-γ). MHC Class I and II expression by passaged and primary cells was maximal (> 90% positive) after incubation with 100 U/ml of rlFN-y for 48 h. ICAM-1 expression by primary and passaged cells tripled between 48 and 72 h after exposure to 25 or 50 U/ml of rIFN-γ. By 72 h after exposure to 100 U/ml of rIFN-y, 62% of the retinal glia were positive for ICAM-1, whereas under normal culture conditions these molecules were detected on < 3% of the retinal glia. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known stimulator of central nervous system (CMS) astrocytes, increased ICAM-1 expression only 3-fold to 9% of cells staining positively, but neither MHC Class I nor Class II expression was altered from baseline levels. Surface expression of ICAM-1, MHC Class I, and MHC Class II was unaffected by exposure to either rTNF-α (1000 U/ml) or rIL-6 (100 U/ml) for 24 h. Under normal culture conditions, intracellular interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were detected immunohistochemically. Exposure to either rIFN-γ or LPS induced more intense staining which correlated with increased secreted levels of both cytokines in culture supernatants. Levels of secreted TNF-α increased 6-fold after stimulation with LPS for 24 h, while secreted IL-6 increased over 9-fold.

In the present study this tentative marker of recurrent infections was used to study the pathogenetic background of otitis media with effusion (OME). Altogether 57 consecutive children, aged 2–11 years, who came for tympanostomy and/or adenoidectomy were divided into three subgroups: 25 of them had OME and a history of recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM/OME +), 20 had OME without an infectious background (inf- /OME +), and 12 had a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections (inf +/OME —) without OME. All the children were free of acute illness at the time of sampling.

The tubule-forming agent (TFA) has also been shown to pass through an 80 nm capillary pore membrane filter, suggesting that it is a small enveloped (or lipid-containing) virus. The TFA can also be recovered from low titer (⩽ 105 infectious doses/ml) chronic-phase chimpanzee plasma by use of a multi-step purification procedure that assumes the agent is a small enveloped RNA virus with an approximate buoyant density of 1.24 g/cm3 and a sedimentation coefficient of 200–280 S.

About onefourth of the sera were positive by ELISA. There was a tendency, however, for the same sera to be positive for all three human and simian retroviruses. Only about one in five of the ELISA antibodypositive sera were confirmed to be positive by Western blotting. False-positive ELISA antibody tests were particularly common among sera from mandrills, crab-eating macaques, lion-tailed macaques, African green monkeys, and DeBrazza's and moustached guenons. Sera that were falsely positive in ELISA antibody tests to the three human and simian retroviruses were found to contain antibodies that reacted at comparable intensity with feline leukemia, infectious peritonitis and panleukopenia viruses. The false anti-viral activity of these sera was found to be due to antibodies that reacted with non-viral proteins that were copurified with all five virus preparations.

Thus, this new assay is 102–104 times more sensitive than our standard neutralization test. Furthermore, this increase in sensitivity has enabled us to reliably detect rhinovirus specific immunoglobulins in unconcentrated nasal washings, which are thought to be particularly important for protection against rhinovirus reinfection.

Nucleocapsid isolated in this manner is amenable to ultrastructural evaluation, protein isolation for the production of monospecific hyperimmune serum, and genomic RNA isolation for cDNA cloning. Nucleocapsid (NC) and a defective NC variant (Df-NC) isolated from 5.5 × 107 Vero cells infected with Ond-CDV is readily visualized on cesium gradients. The calculated density for NC is 1.2976 ± 0.0033 g/ml and 1.2458 ± 0.0056 g/ml for Df-NC. Ultrastructurally, NC appears as long uninterrupted strands, 1.6 ± 0.1 μm in length, 21.2 ± 1.7 nm in diameter, with well defined capsid subunits. Df-NC are truncated with a uniform length of 85.8 ± 7.1 nm and a 24.5 ± 1.3 nm diameter. A total of 2.1 ± 0.2 μ of NC protein is obtained for every 1 × 106 cells infected; 89.7% of this mass is represented by a 61 kDa protein (N), 8.4% by a 75 kDa protein (P), and 1.9% by a 160–200 kDa protein (L), which is in agreement with the NC constituency of other paramyxoviruses. Viral N and P proteins, purified by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, were used in the production of hyperimmune serum. Specificity was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Both antisera were capable of detecting viral antigen in persistently and lytically CDV infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence. A single high molecular weight species of nucleic acid was isolated from purified nucleocapsids compatible with a 14.6 kb morbillivirus genome.

Twenty-five (66%) and 27 (71%) of 38 volunteers inoculated with HRV-14 had evidence of infection by virus isolation and ISH, respectively, on at least one of 4 days investigated after virus challenge. In contrast, only 14 of 38 (37%) volunteers had significant antibody rises as detected by the neutralization test. Of the 38 volunteers inoculated with HRV-14, only 13 (34%) had symptoms of colds. Of these, 12 (92%) and 10 (77%) were positive by virus isolation or ISH, respectively, on at least one day. Six (46%) had significant antibody rises by neutralization. Similarly, of the 38 volunteers challenged, 22 (58%) were asymptomatic and of these 10 (45.5%) and 12 (54.5%) were positive by virus isolation and ISH, respectively, on at least one day. Only 8 (36.4%) of these asymptomatic volunteers showed significant antibody rises by neutralization. There were significant associations between the detection of rhinoviruses by ISH and virus isolation on the third day (P<0.025) after virus challenge in the group as a whole and in the symptomatic group. These results show that generally rhinovirus detection by ISH compares well with virus isolation and both tests are clearly more sensitive than the neutralization test in detecting evidence of infection. It is concluded that ISH is an interesting new technique that may play an important role in the study of rhinovirus infection and pathogenesis.",1990-10-31,"Bruce, Christine; Chadwick, Patricia; Al-Nakib, Widad",Journal of Virological Methods,,,True,custom_license

The ds probes detected a minimum of about 2 × 105 viral genomes after exposure for 1 h, a detection limit similar to nick-translated probes after exposure of the films for 60 h. More than 8 h exposure to blots probed with these ds probes resulted in complete darkening of the film. The ss probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR on linearized plasmids, permitted the detection of 5 × 104 genomes, which equalled the capacity of random-primed probes. Prolonged exposure did not increase the background as in case of ds PCR-probed blots. Probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR and random-priming were labeled to similar specific activities and were better in terms of sensitivity and detectability as opposed to nick-translated probes. However, the specificity of detection with ss probes as to random primed probes was increased further. About 10 viral genomes, after fragment-specific amplification by PCR, were detected by agarose-gel analysis. PCR-probe synthesis was simple, highly reproducible, and allowed the synthesis of probes for specific fragments.",1990-09-30,"Verbeek, Arnold; Tijssen, Peter",Journal of Virological Methods,,,True,custom_license

After further passages in SK-K cell monolayers with undiluted culture fluid, CPE developed earlier and became complete within 48 h postinoculation (p.i.). Viral specific antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of the infected SK-K cells by indirect immunofluorescence using rabbit antiserum against the mouse-passaged virus. The SK-K-passaged virus as well as the original mouse-passaged virus formed clear plaques on SK-K cell monolayers under simple overlay medium. The plaque assay system for HEV 67N was established by studying various factors influencing the plaque formation in the SK-K cell cultures. By this system more than 106 PFU/0.2 ml of the virus yield was detected in the fluid phase of the infected cultures at 48 h p.i. The SK-K-passaged virus caused fatal infection in 4-week-old mice by intracerebral inoculation, but was inhibited by rabbit antiserum against the mouse-passaged virus.

The viruses have four structural proteins; the protein of greatest serological importance is found at the peplomer tip. The viral structural proteins separated by isoelectric focusing were identified by comparison to SDS-PAGE separations. Three protein bands were identical in pI and one protein band showed a difference in pI between strains. When the renatured viral proteins were Western blotted and reacted with strain-specific antiserum, antigen-antibody complexing was seen only at points corresponding to the strain-specific variant bands. For IBV strain Mass-41, antigen-antibody complexing occurred at a pI of 6.8, and, for IBV strain Ark-99, at 7.2. No cross reaction of antisera was observed for either strain. Since tissue affinities are a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells and are often directly related to pathogenicity, it appears that altered pathogenicity of strains of IBV may be detected by alteration of pI of the proteins. Classification by pI of proteins of at least the smaller viruses allows untypeable, highly pathogenic or persistent strains of these viruses to be characterized on the basis of variant proteins.",1991-06-30,"Sadasiv, Eileen C.; Yeh, Tamson T.; Chang, Pei W.",Journal of Virological Methods,,,True,custom_license

The study comprised 67 patients with skin or mucous membrane lesions suggestive of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The sensitivity of EM increased 25% after virus concentration by ultracentrifugation. Herpes virus infection was confirmed in 55 of the 67 cases by EM or VC or both. EM detected 53 herpes virus-positive lesion samples of which 14 were not detected by VC; only two lesion samples that were herpes virus-positive in VC were not detected by EM. The sensitivities of EM, VC, and Tzanck smear for the group of 55 herpes virus-positive cases were 96%, 75% and 76%, respectively. The specificity of the Tzanck smear was 83% (prevalence 82%). Colloidal gold immuno-EM was used to rapidly type HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV) present in skin and mucous membrane lesions in less than 4 h. Immuno-EM was able to detect antiviral antibodies on viral envelopes and viral cores in lesion samples with negative VC. Antiviral antibodies do not interfere with typing of herpes viruses by immuno-EM. It is suggested that formation of viral immune complexes and inactivation of virus particles by antibodies may have caused a negative VC. Improved EM is discussed for its applicability to special cases that cannot rely on VC and cytodiagnosis or when rapid diagnosis is required.",1991-10-31,"Folkers, E.; Vreeswijk, Joh.; Oranje, A.P.; Wagenaar, F.; Duivenvoorden, J.N.",Journal of Virological Methods,,,True,custom_license

TMB substrate is used for color development. Negative S/N values (defined as the absorbance at 650 nm of test sera/absorbance at 650 nm of negative control sera) of >0.80 were obtained with immune sera from gnotobiotic cattle immunized with several bovine viruses, with bovine antisera to bovine herpesvirus-2, and vesicular stomatitis virus, with porcine antisera to pseudorabies virus and parvovirus, and with normal sera from heterologous species. Negative S/N values were also obtained with sera from rabbits twice vaccinated with IBRV(NG)dltkdlgIII. However, the S/N values became positive (S/N <0.8) 10 to 17 days after the rabbits were challenge exposed to virulent IBRV(Cooper).

This method is based on the binding of RNA to acid-treated glass beads in the presence of a high molarity of guanidinium salt. It can be completed within an hour, and obviates the need for dewaxing and phenol/chloroform extractions. The effect of various fixatives and fixation times was tested and the amplification of actin mRNA fragments ranging in length from 82 to 507 bp was used to demonstrate the presence of RNA in the extracts. The method was compared to existing extraction techniques by studying the quality of the templates for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR), using virus-infected and mock-infected paraffin-embedded cell pellets as a model. PCR amplification of cellular and viral RNA was successful for RNA isolated by use of all extraction techniques, although the glass bead method was preferred for its simplicity and rapidity. Specimens fixed with formalin were found to be suitable for PCR, but the best results were obtained with acetone-fixed paraffin-embedded material. Dewaxing of tissue sections had no effect on the yield and quality of RNA extractions, and further purification of the extracts using gel filtration did not improve the results. After the protocols were optimized, rotavirus-infected cell pellets were used to demonstrate that extraction and amplification of dsRNA was possible. The information obtained from the studies with the model system was used for extraction of toroviral and rotaviral RNA from archival intestinal material.

In an attempt to develop an efficient in vitro cultivation system for enterotropic MHV strains (MHV-RI and MHV-Y), 8 murine cell lines were inoculated with MHV-RI- or MHV-Y-infected infant mouse intestinal homogenates and screened for the production of cytopathic effects. MHV-RI and MHV-Y consistently produced cytopathic effects only in J774A.1 cells. Both strains produced titers of 106 TCID50/ml in subsequent passages in J774.1 cells. MHV strains -1, -3, -A59, -JHM, -S and -DVIM also produced high-titer viral stocks in J774A.1 cells. Therefore J774A.1 cells are the first cells found that support the replication of these 8 enterotropic and respiratory MHV strains. After passage in J774A.1 cells, MHV-RI and MHV-Y could infect previously non-susceptible cell lines (17C1-1, CMT-93, N18 and NCTC 1469), though cytopathic effects were often negligible with MHV-RI. MHV-Y, but not MHV-RI, grew in L2(Percy) cells. Using L2(Percy) cells, an agarose overlay and Giemsa staining, MHV-Y could be quantified by plaque assay.

Host antibodies induced following EAV infection bound the recombinant antigen by ELISA. The ELISA specificity and sensitivity were determined with a panel of equine sera including postinfection and postvaccination samples. A good correlation existed between EAV neutralizing antibody titers and ELISA absorbance values (r = 0.827). The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 99.6 and 90.1%, respectively, compared with the EAV neutralization test and the recombinant antigen did not crossreact in ELISA with equine sera directed against other common equine respiratory viruses. Three post-EAV infection equine sera raised against different EAV isolates reacted strongly in the ELISA, as did two equine sera raised against EAV vaccines, indicating that the viral epitope was conserved between the viruses tested. Following vaccination with an inactivated whole virus vaccine, antibody detected with the recombinant antigen ELISA preceded the development of a virus-neutralizing response.

However, the diagnosis of human coronavirus infections is not carried out routinely, primarily because the isolation and propagation of these viruses in tissue culture is difficult and time consuming. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of recombinant, bacterial expressed proteins in the serodiagnosis of coronavirus infections. Two proteins were examined: the human coronavirus 229E nucleocapsid protein (N), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pUR and the coronavirus 229E surface glycoprotein (S), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pROS. The recombinant proteins were used as antigens in Western blot (WB) assays to detect the 229E-specific IgG antibodies and the results were compared with a standard serological method, indirect immunofluorescence. Serum samples of 51 paediatric patients, suffering from acute respiratory illness, and 10 adults, voluntarily infected with human coronavirus, were tested. The serum samples of the adult group had coronavirus-specific IgG antibodies in both test systems. In contrast, only 8 51 sera of the paediatric group were positive for coronavirus-specific IgG by both WB and IF and 20 51 sera were positive by WB, but not by IF. The overall incidence of human coronavirus infections in the paediatric age group was 55% evaluated by WB analysis and 16% evaluated by IF. This study shows that recombinant human coronavirus 229E proteins are suitable reagents for the epidemiological screening of coronavirus 229E infections.",1995-10-31,"Pohl-Koppe, A.; Raabe, T.; Siddell, S.G.; ter Meulen, V.",Journal of Virological Methods,,,True,custom_license

The 35S-labeled RNA probes were generated from two plasmids pPSP.FP1 and pPSP.FP2 containing part of the S gene of TGEV. The procedure was first standardized in cell cultures. The radiolabeled pPSP.FP2 probe detected both TGEV and PRCV in virus-inoculated cell cultures, whereas pPSP.FP1 probe detected TGEV but not PRCV. The probe was then used to detect TGEV or PRCV in tissues of pigs experimentally infected with TGEV or PRCV or naturally infected with TGEV. Again, the probes detected TGEV in intestines of experimentally and naturally infected pigs and PRCV in the lungs of experimentally infected pigs. TGEV RNA was detected mainly within the enterocytes at the tips of villi and, less often, within some crypt epithelial cells. PRCV was shown to replicate mainly in the bronchiolar epithelial cells and in lesser amount in type II pneumocytes, type I pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, respectively. ISH has potential applications as a diagnostic test for the detection and differentiation of TGEV and PRCV in tissues and in studies to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis of enteric and respiratory coronavirus infections.",1996-02-29,"Sirinarumitr, Theerapol; Paul, Prem S.; Kluge, John P.; Halbur, Patrick G.",Journal of Virological Methods,,,True,custom_license

Equilibrium constants could be calculated for four of the five mAbs tested. These were in the nanomolar range. The ranking order was very similar to that obtained with an affinity ELISA, (an equilibrium system) but as others have found, affinities were 2–10-fold lower as measured by SPR (a flow system). No data were obtained with mAb HC58 although it had one of the highest affinities using an ELISA format, and was 28-fold higher than another mAb (HC10) which gave good data by SPR. This may relate to the orientation of its binding on the virion surface. The K dissoc. of the Fabs was only 3–10-fold higher compared to their IgGs. Fab from the lowest affinity IgG (HC10) could not be measured, possibly because it fell below the threshold for detection.",1996-10-31,"Schofield, D.J.; Dimmock, N.J.",Journal of Virological Methods,,,True,custom_license

The viral subunit was released from the virion by sonication and was separated from intact virus and other viral components by isopycnic centrifugation. It had a buoyant density in sucrose of 1.02 g/ml. Further purification consisted of gel filtration through Sephadex G200, in which process the immunogen, with a molecular weight of approximately 25 000, was the last component to be eluted. A group of ten young, weaned swine, inoculated intramuscularly with two or three 1-mg doses of the viral subunit were protected against challenge with virulent TGE virus, probably by the induction of secretory IgA. The immunogen also induced a humoral immune response of variable magnitude (titers ranging from 8 to 5 625) in the animals. These antibodies are not believed to be directly related to protection against infection. They can, however, be easily identified by serologic procedures and may serve as a convenient indicator of responsiveness to the TGE viral immunogen.",1983-09-30,"Gough, Patricia M.; Ellis, Carmen H.; Frank, Clifford J.; Johnson, Carl J.",Antiviral Research,,,True,custom_license

Thus, the prevalence and clinical importance of virus infections and the need for antiviral drugs differ from place to place and from time to time. National and World Health Statistics of notifications of disease give some index of the incidence of infections but not all virus infections are notifiable. Such statistics can be misleading also through failures to notify from sloth on the part of the physician or, in the absence of pathognomonic symptoms or signs, from errors in diagnosis. Any assessment of the need for new antiviral drugs should consider the availability, safety, effectiveness and cost of alternative measures, including prevention of spread of infection by control of vectors, immunization by use of viral vaccines, or treatment with existing antiviral drugs. Early start of treatment of acute virus infections with existing drugs gives the best results and, where the clinical diagnosis is uncertain, accurate rapid virus diagnosis is of paramount importance. Many virus infections are asymptomatic or of trivial importance and without sequelae. However, new or improved antiviral drugs are needed for the prevention and/or treatment of a number of significant conditions caused by viruses which are not at present adequately controlled. These include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, influenza, chronic hepatitis, gastroenteritis, infectious mononucleosis, measles, rabies, haemorrhagic fevers and warts. Furthermore, such drugs might prove of therapeutic value in the prevention or treatment of virus-associated tumours, such as hepatoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and possibly carcinoma of the cervix.",1985-12-31,"Freestone, D.S.",Antiviral Research,,,True,custom_license

These are important in determining the final configuration of specific glycoproteins. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) encodes a number of glycoproteins, some of which ultimately reside in the outer envelope of the mature virion and are important for virus infectivity. Treatment with three polyhydroxyalkaloids, castanospermine (CAST), deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and 2R,5R-dihydroxymethyl-3R, 4R-dihydroxypyrrolidine (DMDP) blocked the growth of infectious virus, as determined by yield reduction and plaque reduction assays. However, in the presence of CAST, CMV infected cells continued to shed virions into the extracellular medium, as determined by electron microscopy. Envelope glycoproteins of virions produced after treatment with CAST (2.5 mM) were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody (F5) specific for the gcI family of glycoproteins. Analysis by PAGE-SDS showed an absence of gcI complex 2 (gp52 disulphide-linked to gp130) with a proportional increase in gcI complex 1 (gp52 disulphide-linked to gp95). The results indicated that gp130 alone, or linked to gp52, was important for CMV infectivity.

When administered intraperitoneally in divided doses, significant protection from death was conferred at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day given 24 and 17 h pre-virus inoculation, 25–100 mg/kg/day administered 4 h pre- and 3 h post-virus challenge, and 12.5 to 100 mg/kg/day administered 24 and 31 h after virus inoculation. These doses preventing death reduced liver icterus scores, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and liver and serum virus titers relative to placebo controls. Full daily doses administered at 24 h were somewhat less protective to mice than divided daily doses starting at the same time. The initiation of treatment could be delayed as late as 36 h after virus inoculation, resulting in complete protection from mortality at 100 mg/kg/day. This prevention of death occurred despite the acute nature of the infection which resulted in deaths by 96 h in the placebo-treated controls. These results show that 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine has both prophylactic and therapeutic potential as an anti-Phlebovirus agent. Interferon induction appears to be the reason for antiviral activity in this model, since up to 10000 units of interferon/ml were induced in mice 1 h after treatment with 100 mg 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine per kg, and antibody to interferon α/β administered shortly after treatment with the nucleoside negated the antiviral effect.",1991-04-30,"Smee, Donald F.; Huffman, John H.; Gessaman, Ann C.; Huggins, John W.; Sidwell, Robert W.",Antiviral Research,,,True,custom_license

Half-daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) doses of each substance administered 24 and 18 h prior to i.p. virus challenge protected the majority of mice infected with banzi, encephalomyocarditis, San Angelo, and Semliki Forest viruses at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. These compounds at 100 mg/kg/day also protected most suckling rats infected intranasally with rat coronavirus. However, no survival benefit was afforded to treated mice infected intranasally with vesicular stomatitis virus. 8-Cl-7-dzguo was orally active against Semliki Forest virus in mice at 200 and 400 mg/kg/day, whereas 7-dzTOGuo is reported to not be effective orally. In uninfected mice, the two compounds induced similar amounts of interferon following i.p. injections. Interferon was induced by oral treatments with 8-Cl-7-dzGuo but not with 7-dzTOGuo. Fifty percent acute lethal doses to uninfected mice treated i.p. in half-daily doses for one day with 7-deazaguanosine (7-dzGuo), 7-dzTOGuo, and 8-Cl-7-dzGuo were 400, 600 and > 1600 (no mortality at this dose) mg/kg/day, respectively. Daily, i.p. treatments for 14 days with these substances (100 mg/kg/day) showed 7-dzGuo as 100% lethal and the other two substances at not toxic.

The immunomodulating activity was measured by increases in phagocytic activity and in nitric oxide production by peritoneal macrophages from mice treated with both free and LIP-IFN-γ (4000 U/mouse, intraperitoneal injection). Resident peritoneal macrophages harvested from mice treated with free unencapsulated IFN-γ or muramyl dipeptide showed significant increases in macrophage yield, and enhanced ability to phagocytize zymosan particles. In mice treated with liposome-encapsulated IFN-γ (LIP-IFN-γ), both macrophage yield and phagocytic activity further increased by 2-fold over unencapsulated IFN-γ. In addition, the activation of peritoneal macrophages with LIP-IFN-γ showed enhanced production of NO when the cells were cultured ex vivo. Using a murine respiratory influenza infection model, intranasally administered LIP-IFN-γ conferred protection to 70% in mice challenged intranasally with 10 LD50 doses of influenza A/PR/8 virus compared with a 20% survival rate using free IFN-γ. Together these results suggest that liposome-encapsulation increases the immunomodulating and antiviral activities of IFN-γ. Liposome-encapsulation of IFN-γ may provide additional therapeutic advantages by reducing IFN-γ toxicity while prolonging its body retention.",1996-03-31,"Saravolac, E.G.; Kournikakis, B.; Gorton, L.; Wong, J.P.",Antiviral Research,,,True,custom_license

Chemical probing experiments have been done both in the presence and absence of the initiator tRNA with dimethyl sulfate, kethoxal and carbodiimide as reagent probes. As an mRNA, a mini-mRNA containing the initiation region of bacteriophage λ gene cro has been used. This region is characterized by a long single-stranded Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence followed by two hairpin structures of which the first one comprises in its loop the initiation codon. As compared to a free mRNA, the only nucleotides additionally protected in the binary mRNA-ribosome complex have been those which belong to the S-D sequence and the initiation codon. The protection of other nucleotides has not changed. Addition of the initiator RNA results in the modification of nucleotides in the stems of the downstream hairpin structures of the initiation region. This reflects their transition into a single-stranded conformation promoted by tRNA.

The enzyme is reversibly inhibited in a time-dependent manner by amastatin. Slow development of tAP inhibition by this inhibitor could be demonstrated. Dissociation of the complex of tAP with amastatin is also slow. Two molar equivalents of the inhibitor are bound by the enzyme suggesting the presence of one catalytic site in each subunit. Chemical modification of tAP with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbonyl-metho-p-toluene sulfonate and N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinone revealed the presence of essential acidic amino acid residues probably located at the active site. Compatible with the presence of arginine and tyrosine residues at the catalytic site of most metalloproteinases, tAP is reversibly inhibited by phenylglyoxal and inactivated by tetranitromethane in a time-dependent fashion. The rate of inhibition by these modifiers could be significantly decreased if the enzyme was previously treated with amastatin suggesting that the modified amino acid residues are located at the catalytic site. Diethylpyrocarbonate did not affect the activity of both native and zinc-depleted tAP suggesting that histidine is not involved in the zinc-ligand formation.",1995-09-06,"Hajjou, Mustapha; Le Gal, Yves",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Protein Structure and Molecular Enzymology,,,True,custom_license

To determine the possible role of common enteric pathogens in this disease, 40 veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (cases) and 25 dairy calves diagnosed with enteric infection (control) were investigated. The veal calves were negative for several known enteric pathogens except for pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates that expressed multiple virulence attributes. To determine whether such isolates have a significant association with hemorrhagic enteritis in veal calves, we compared the prevalence of pathogenic E. coli in the 40 veal calves with the prevalence of similar E. coli in the dairy calves that were diagnosed with colibacillosis within the same season of the year. Escherichia coli isolates from the two groups of calves were tested for several properties of E. coli related to pathogenicity, i.e. production of verotoxins, heat-stable enterotoxin (STa), heat-labile enterotoxin, enterohemolysin, K99 fimbrial antigens, hemagglutination activity, and attachment to Hep-2 tissue culture cells. Escherichia coli that produces STa were more commonly isolated from veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (45%) than from dairy calves with enteritis (12%) (P<0.05). Various patterns of attachment of E. coli to Hep-2 tissue culture cells were studied. The E. coli that demonstrated aggregative patterns of attachment were more commonly represented in veal calves (32%) than in dairy calves (8%). We observed that there was no correlation between STa production and K99 pili expression among the enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolates that were recovered from veal calves. This may indicate the emergence of K99-negative ETEC, probably as a result of the wide use of K99-based vaccines.",1993-10-31,"Saeed, A.Mahdi; Bowersock, T.; Runnels, L.; Teclaw, R.F.",Preventive Veterinary Medicine,,,True,custom_license

Of the total 569 herds tested, 65.2% were positive only to PRCV, 8.6% were positive to TGEV and 22.8% had mixed infections. The first appearance of antibodies coincided with large importation of feeder pigs from Belgium and Holland.

The focus was on infectious diseases which could be transmitted to the finishing units with delivered growers, and which might have some influence on partial carcass condemnations (PCC) in meat inspection. Farm visits were done by a veterinarian (senior author) assisted by a technician. Colostrum samples (average 22 per herd) were taken in 100 herds, and analyzed for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (A. pleur) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M.hyo) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Only nine of 114 herds were judged to be free of mange. It was concluded that all finishing units received mange-infected feeder pigs each time the unit was filled. One or more acute erysipelas outbreaks had occurred in every fifth herd during the previous year. The risk of a finishing unit receiving feeder pigs carrying erysipelas was considered to be high. Swine dysentery (Serpulina hyodysenteriae) was not found to be a problem in the LSO area. Clostridium perfringens type C enteritis was found in eight (7%) herds. Seven of these herds were located in those supply areas where the PCC percentage of feeder pigs was high. In spite of statistical connection no causality between this disease and PCC was presumed. There were no previous diagnoses of respiratory diseases but spontaneous coughing was observed in 5% of the herds. Provocation testing induced coughing in 22% of herds but not serious coughing in any herd. Managers had observed coughing in 15% of herds. Ninety-one herds were positive in a colostrum ELISA for A. pleur antibodies, and eight herds were positive for M.hyo antibodies. A.pleur-positive herds had several positive or samples suspected of being positive in each herd bu M.hyo-positive herds had only one or two positive or suspected samples per herd. Six of the M.hyo herds were located in the high PCC area, two in the average PCC area and none in the low PCC area. M.hyo was suggested to be one of the possible explanations for geographical variation of PCC. Atrophic rhinitis was not considered to be of importance in LSO.",1994-05-31,"Tuovinen, Veikko K.; Levonen, Katri H.; Gröhn, YrjöT.; Straw, Barbara E.",Preventive Veterinary Medicine,,,True,custom_license

Of the sampled herds, 101 (25.8%) had sow seroprevalences of at least 80%, 79 (20.1%) had seroprevalences between 10 and 79%, and 212 (54.1%) were seronegative. For evaluation of risk factors for TGE seropositivity, analysis was restricted to herds with at least five tested sows and either 0% or at least 20% seropositive sows. In the logistic regression analysis, a herd was considered seropositive if at least 20% of sampled females had titers of 1: 8 or higher (n = 160), and a herd was seronegative if all females had titers of under 1: 8 (n = 178). Factors considered for inclusion in logistic regression models included breeding herd size, biosecurity measures, pig introductions and movements, and access of possible nonporcine reservoirs to the facilities with pigs. After controlling for the effects of season, number of samples tested and TGE vaccination history, large female breeding herd size (at least 500 sows compared with the reference category of 100–199 sows) and purchase of more than 25 pigs from non-specific pathogen free (SPF) herds were associated with significantly (P<0.05) higher odds of herd seropositivity (odds ratios 4.9 and 3.9, respectively).

To determine risk factors associated with the introduction of PRCV, a cross-sectional study of 408 Danish swine herds was carried out between May 1985 and June 1986. The association between herd-PRCV serological status and possible risk factors, obtained from a field questionnaire, was assessed by unconditional maximum likelihood logistic regression. An increasing herd size, location in the Jutland peninsula (compared with location on the island of Funen) (OR = 7.9 in a multivariable logistic regression model not including interaction terms), the presence of a slurry system (i.e. pigs living on a slatted floor) (OR = 4.6) and purchase of pigs (OR= 1.7) were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with seropositivity. Two significant interactions, both involving herd size, were subsequently identified. The PRCV serological status of neighbouring herds was found to be related, and closeness of a seropositive herd was associated with an increased risk of a herd being serologically positive. The results of this study indicate that herd size may be an important determinant of airborne transmission of PRCV infection, and that herd size may modify the effect of other risk factors.",1995-11-30,"Flori, J.; Mousing, J.; Gardner, I.; Willeberg, P.; Have, P.",Preventive Veterinary Medicine,,,True,custom_license

The objectives of the study were to describe the epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in dairy calves from birth to 16 weeks of age (with an emphasis on respiratory disease), to examine individual calf and herd management practices as risk factors for calf morbidity and mortality, and to validate producer diagnosis of mortality. Incidence rates for all morbidity, enteritis, and pneumonia were 0.20, 0.15, and 0.10 cases per 100 calf-days at risk for the period of the study. Risk of enteritis was highest in the first 3 weeks of life, with pneumonia risk highest at 10 weeks of age. Case fatality rates averaged 11.8%, 17.9%, and 9.4% for all diagnoses, enteritis, and pneumonia, respectively. Average daily rates of gain from birth to 16 weeks of age differed between farms that had inadequate calf housing (0.8 kg day−1) versus those with adequate calf housing (1.0 kg day−1). Approximately half of the calves in the cohort (418) had blood samples taken monthly from birth until 16 weeks of age. Of the calves sampled, only 19 calves showed a four-fold rise in serum titers to respiratory viruses. Sixteen calves seroconverted to BVDV, two calves to IBRV, and one calf to PI3 virus. Of 98 calves less than 10 days of age tested for adequacy of passive transfer, 35 (35.7%) had serum immunoglobulin levels of less than 800 mg dl−1. There were no significant differences in mortality or morbidity between calves that had adequate passive transfer and those that did not. The incidence of mortality was 0.08 deaths per 100 calf-days at risk; 64 calves died during the 16 months of the study. The risk of death was highest at 2 weeks of age. Enteritis was the most common cause of death (28 deaths, 44% of all deaths) followed by pneumonia (19 deaths, 30% of all deaths). Comparing producer diagnosis of mortality with necropsy results yielded sensitivities of 58.3% and 56% and specificities of 93% and 100% for producer diagnoses of enteritis and pneumonia, respectively. The kappa statistic comparing producer diagnosis with necropsy result was 0.47. The most common pathogens isolated from calves that died of enteritis were rotavirus (five calves), and Escherichia coli (four calves). Pathogens isolated from pneumonic lungs included Pasteurella multocida (three calves), Haemophilus somnus (three calves), and Pasteurella haemolytica (one calf).",1996-07-31,"Sivula, N.J; Ames, T.R; Marsh, W.E; Werdin, R.E",Preventive Veterinary Medicine,,,True,custom_license

These behavioral changes are thought to be associated with one or both of the following: (a) changes in frequencies of genes or gene complexes due to the effects of inbreeding or to changes in selection pressure; (b) changes in development of the phenotype due to the effects of changes in environmental variables. Inbreeding leads to increase in homozygosity, that may result in developmental anomalies because of a breakdown in developmental homeostasis. Changes in selection pressure may disrupt coadapted gene complexes that have evolved in the wild. Often, domestication is believed to result in individuals that are “degenerate”; i.e. inferior to individuals in the wild. However, this notion has received no empirical support. In fact, if phenotype changes do occur under domestication, these are usually quantitative, not qualitative, in nature. We suggest that the study of the domestication process may reveal evolutionary principles that would be difficult to discover in other ways, and the zoological parks may be ideal situations for such research.",1987-07-31,"Ricker, Jeffry P.; Skoog, Linda A.; Hirsch, Jerry",Applied Animal Behaviour Science,,,True,custom_license

The leader-coding sequences at the 5'-end of genomic RNA are at least 72 nucleotides in length and are joined to the viral mRNAs by a unique mechanism. Utilizing a leader-specific cDNA probe, we have detected several free leader RNA species ranging from 70 to 82 nucleotides in length. The predominant leader RNA was approximately 75 nucleotides. In addition, larger distinct leader-containing RNAs were also detected ranging from 130 to 250 nucleotides in length. The 70–82-nucleotide leader-related RNAs were present in both the cytosol and membrane fractions of infected cells. They were also detected only in the small RNA fractions but not associated with the replicative-intermediate RNA. These data suggest that the leader RNAs were associated with the membrane-bound transcription complex but at least part of them were dissociated from the RNA template. We have also identified a temperature-sensitive mutant, which synthesizes only leader RNA but not mRNAs at nonpermissive temperature, indicating that leader RNA synthesis is distinct from the transcription of mRNAs. These data support the leader-primed mechanism for coronavirus transcription and suggest that one or more free leader RNAs are used as primers of mRNA synthesis.",1985-07-31,"Baric, Ralph S.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Razavi, Mahmood K.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

The extent of papaverine-induced suppression of viral growth was dependent on drug dose and treatment regimen. Cells progressively recovered their viral permissive state after removal of drug. The cyclic nucleotide, cGMP, nullified the inhibitory effect of papaverine if added to cells during drug treatment. Pulse labeling experiments with [35S]methionine showed that papaverine compromises production of all virus-specific proteins in infected cells without adversely affecting host cell protein synthesis. Treatment of cells with papaverine strongly inhibited the production of viral RNA and both cellular RNA and DNA. It was found that VSV causes an immediate but transient stimulation of DNA synthesis in HEp-2 cells which is prevented by papaverine treatment. This drug also selectively blocked primary transcription of VSV in vivo and to a lesser extent in vitro RNA polymerase activity of the virion-bound transcriptase. The finding that papaverine has a strong inhibitory effect on viral biosynthesis including early transcription suggests that VSV replication may depend on host factors that regulate intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP.",1985-07-31,"Mukherjee, Pranab K.; Simpson, Robert W.",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

JHMV can remain up to 20 days in the latent state and about 14 days before the cultures lose the capacity to resume virus production upon return to 32.5°C. Although persistently and latently infected RN2-2 cells display resistance to superinfection by a heterologous agent VSV, these cells do not release detectable soluble mediators (e.g., interferon) of the antiviral state. Nevertheless, RN2-2 cells are competent to synthesize and release interferon when treated with the appropriate inducers. These observations suggest that interferon does not play any role or may not be the major factor in the control of latency in the Schwannoma cell. Hybridization with virus-specific cDNAs shows that all viral mRNAs are present during latency and that viral mRNAs are present in the polysomes of infected cells at 39.5°C. Western immunoblotting with hybridoma antibodies demonstrates that viral specific proteins are produced at the restrictive temperature.

Four major protein species were resolved by electrophoresis and many of their properties were deduced from digestion studies using proteolytic enzymes. The four proteins are: (1) A 190 kDa protein, the presumed peplomeric protein, that was glycosylated and proteolytically cleavable by trypsin into subunits of 110 and 90 kDa. The subunits each represent a different amino acid sequence on the basis of peptide mapping; (2) a 130 kDa protein that was glycosylated and behaved as a disulfide-linked dimer of 65 kDa molecules. It is the apparent virion hemagglutinin on the basis of digestion studies with trypsin, bromelain and pronase; (3) a 55 kDa nucleocapsid protein that was phosphorylated; (4) a 26 kDa matrix protein that was glycosylated. The 190, 130, 55 and 26 kDa species can therefore be designated P, H, N and M, respectively.

Gen. Virol. 66, 719–726). The order of the two glycopolypeptides within So is aminoterminus(N)-Sl-S2-carboxyterminus(C). To locate the N-terminus of S2 we have performed partial amino acid sequencing on S2 from IBV-Beaudette labelled with [3H]serine and from the related strain IBV-M41 labelled with [3H]valine, leucine and isoleucine. The residues identified and their positions relative to the N-terminus of S2 were: serine, 13; valine, 6, 12; leucine, none in the first 20 residues; isoleucine, 2, 19. These results identified the N-terminus of S2 of IBV-Beaudette as serine, 520 residues from the N-terminus of S1, excluding the signal sequence. Immediately to the N-terminal side of residue 520 So has the sequence Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg; similar basic connecting peptides are a feature of several other virus spike glycoproteins. It was deduced that for IBV-Beaudette SI comprises 519 residues (M r 57.0K) or 514 residues (56.2K) if the connecting peptide was to be removed by carboxypeptidase-like activity in vivo while S2 has 625 residues (69.2K). Nucleotide sequencing of the cleavage region of the So gene of IBV-M41 revealed the same connecting peptide as IBV-Beaudette and that the first 20 N-terminal residues of S2 of IBV-M41 were identical to those of the Beaudette strain. IBV-Beaudette grown in Vero cells had some uncleaved So; this was cleavable by 10 μg/ml of trypsin and of chymotrypsin. Partial N-terminal analysis of S1 from IBV-M41 identified leucine and valine residues at positions 2 and 9 respectively from the N-terminus. This confirms the identification made by Binns et al. (1985), of the N-terminus of S1 and the end of the signal sequence of the IBV-Beaudette spike propolypeptide. N-terminal sequencing of [3H]leucine-labelled IBV-Beaudette membrane (M) polypeptide showed leucine residues at positions 8,16 and 22 from the N-terminus; these results confirm the open reading frame identified by M.E.G.

Several proteases hydrolysed all or some of the membrane glycopoly-peptide (M; M r 30K) and removed about 1.3K of peptide from the amino-(N-)-terminus plus both glycans, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. N-terminal analysis of [3H]isoleucine-labelled M after hydrolysis by bromelain revealed that the first nine residues had been removed. After the virions had been permeabilised with saponin, a further 2.5K decrease in molecular weight was produced and this was shown to be from the carboxy-(C-)terminus. When considered with the hydropathicity plot analysis of the amino acid sequence of M (Boursnell, M.E.G. et al., 1984, Virus Res. 1, 303–313) these results suggest that as few as 9–20 N-terminal amino acid residues may protrude at the outer membrane surface and that there is a highly protease sensitive sequence of an estimated 20–25 residues at the C-terminus of M exposed in the lumen of the virion. S2 but not SI was cleaved to a major glycopolypeptide of approximately 71K by several proteases, and to 76K by trypsin. N-terminal sequencing of the 71K glycopolypeptide revealed that it had the same N-terminus as intact S2.

Thus the drug has markedly altered the subcellular distribution of the glycoproteins so that they accumulate in the internal smooth membranes but are virtually absent in the plasma membrane. These glycoproteins that accumulated in intracellular membranes have a cytoplasmic domain susceptible to protease digestion and thus are transmembranous. Under such conditions, the behavior of M protein, which plays a crucial role in virus assembly (Y. Nagai et al., 1976, Virology 69, 523–538), has been analyzed. It has been found that the M protein can neither associate with the internal membranes nor bind to the plasma membrane. Thus no virus budding has been observed, either at the plasma membranes or at internal membranes. These results substantiate the view that the interaction between M and glycoproteins is of great importance for virus assembly and suggest further that this interaction is possible only when the glycoproteins have been incorporated into the plasma membrane.",1986-02-28,"Tetsuya, Yoshida; Yasuhiro, Nakayama; Hiroshi, Nagura; Tetsuya, Toyoda; Kazuo, Nishikawa; Michinari, Hamaguchi; Yoshiyuki, Nagai",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

(1986) J. Virol. 57, 328–334). In the present study, the fate of the residual genomic RNA synthesized in the presence of cycloheximide was determined. Nearly all of the genomic RNA synthesized in the presence of drug was incorporated into nucleocapsid structures, suggesting that even in the absence of protein synthesis, genomic RNA synthesis and encapsidation are coupled in MHV-infected cells. Sufficient free nucleocapsid N protein was available for this purpose, since the pool of soluble N protein was determined to decay with a half-life of approximately one hour. Negative strand RNA is the template for the synthesis of both genomic and subgenomic positive strand RNA, and would be predicted to accumulate primarily during the early phases of the lytic cycle. In agreement with this prediction, negative strand RNA accumulated during the first 5–6 h of infection, with little additional accumulation occurring over the next 2.5 h. In marked contrast, positive strand RNA increased 5–6-fold over the same 2.5 h period. These results, taken in conjunction with published data, suggest that negative strand RNA is synthesized during the early period of the infectious cycle and is stable in infected cells and also suggest that treatment with cycloheximide at late times does not inhibit positive strand RNA synthesis indirectly by blocking the formation of negative strand templates.",1986-12-31,"Perlman, Stanley; Ries, Dana; Bolger, Eric; Lung-Ji, Chang; Stoltzfus, C.Martin",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

Site A contains three non-overlapping epitopes (A1, A2 and A3). A1 is the only linear epitope; all remaining epitopes are conformational. MAbs which react with epitopes A2 and A3 inhibit neuraminidase activity (NA) when assayed with neuraminlactose. Site B contains three partially overlapping epitopes (B1, B2 and B3) and site C is represented by a single epitope (C1). HN gene sequence analysis of MAb-resistant mutants showed that they each had only single amino acid substitutions which range from amino acid residues 347–460 for site A, 284–325 for site B, and at 481 for the Cl epitope. The apparent molecular mass of the HN glycoprotein of one mutant was increased from 72 to 75 kDa.

Wild type JHM virus has the propensity to cause lytic infections in glial cultures, and a temperature-sensitive mutant designated JHM-ts43 invariably produces persistent infections with reduced cytopathic effects (CPE) as compared to the wild type. Moreover, a non-neurotropic isolate, designated JHM-Pi virus, produces either non-productive persistent infections at low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) or productive persistent infections at high m.o.i., with, however, no CPE. The phenotypic expression of persistence is glial cell-dependent, since all three viruses produce similarly lytic infections when grown on various susceptible cell lines.

Despite the fact that the strains had been isolated over three decades in Europe and the U.S.A. there was only 4% base and 6% amino acid variation within the group. Nearly one third of the 32 amino acid differences in S1 were in two hypervariable regions (HVRs 1 and 2) comprising residues 38–51 and 99–115, identified by Niesters et al. (1986), showing that HVRs 1 and 2 are a feature of the Mass serotype. Amino acid variation within HVRs 1 and 2 was 29% and 40% respectively. Five vaccine strains could be distinguished from each other by sequencing of the first 337 nucleotides. Variants of M41 which resisted neutralization by two monoclonal antibodies (A13 and A38) had the same, single base change at position 134, resulting in substitution of proline residue 45 by histidine. This indicates that residues within HVR 1 are associated with epitopes which induce neutralizing antibody.",1988-09-30,"Cavanagh, David; Davis, Philip J.; Mockett, A.P.Adrian",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

Four antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) were defined by competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) selected from 9 fusions. About 20% (197) of the hybridomas specific for TGE virus produced neutralizing MAbs specific for site A, which was one of the antigenically dominant determinants. Site A was differentiated in three antigenic subsites: a, b and c, by characterization of 11 MAb resistant (mar) mutants, that were defined by 8, 3, and 3 MAbs, respectively. These subsites were further subdivided in epitopes. A total of 11 epitopes were defined in E2 glycoprotein, eight of which were critical for virus neutralization. Neutralizing MAbs were obtained only when native virus was used to immunize mice, although to produce hybridomas mice immunizations were made with antigen in the native, denatured, or mixtures of native and denatured form. All neutralizing MAbs reacted to conformational epitopes. The antigenic structure of the E2-glycoprotein has been defined with murine MAbs, but the antigenic sites were relevant in the swine, the natural host of the virus, because porcine sera reacted against these sites. MAbs specific for TGE virus site C reacted to non-immune porcine sera. This reactivity was not directed against porcine immunoglobulins. These results indicated that TGE virus contains epitope(s) also present in some non-immunoglobulin component of porcine serum.",1988-04-30,"Correa, Isabel; Jiménez, Gustavo; Suñé, Carlos; Bullido, María J.; Enjuanes, Luis",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

In this study, eight additional gC negative (gC−) mutants derived from KOS-321 were shown to vary widely in their ability to induce lethal encephalitis in female DBA/2 mice following intracerebral inoculation. This variation in virulence showed no correlation with thymidine kinase activity. One less virulent gC− strain, gC−39, was further studied to determine whether the neurovirulent phenotype could be restored by rescue of the gC gene using standard marker rescue cotransfection procedures. The resulting progeny contained 2% gC+ recombinant virions and was tested for its ability to cause encephalitis. Although this progeny had increased virulence, it was not attributable to the acquisition of the gC gene since passive immunization of mice with a pool of anti-gC monoclonal antibodies had no effect on the development of encephalitis and only gC−viruses were isolated from diseased brain tissues. In agreement with these findings, individual plaque-purified gC positive (gC+) virus recombinants were shown not to have been restored to the wild-type virus level of neurovirulence. It is concluded that gC is not a virulence determinant in this mouse model of HSV-induced encephalitis and that cotransfection procedures can induce additional mutations that affect viral pathogenesis.",1988-08-31,"Sunstrum, James C.; Chrisp, Clarence E.; Levine, Myron; Glorioso, Joseph C.",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

To determine if TRTV belongs to one of the three defined genera of this family (Paramyxovirus, Morbillivirus and Pneumovirus) we have analysed the RNA and proteins induced during replication of TRTV in Vero cells. Following replication in the presence of actinomycin D 10 polyadenylated RNA bands, ranging in M r from 0.22 to 2.0 × 106, were detected in infected cells; some bands probably contained 2 or more RNA species. Viral proteins were studied after radiolabelling in the presence of [35S]methionine and [3H]glucosamine. Comparison of the polypeptides in mock-infected and infected cells, virions and nucleocapsids and after lentil-lectin chromatography and immunoprecipitation revealed seven virus-specific polypeptides (p), some of which were glycosylated (gp): gp82 (M r 82K), gp68, gp53, gp15, p43, p40 and p35. These are considered to be analogous to the large glycopolypeptide (HN, H and G), fusion protein precursor F0, the F protein cleavage products F1 and F2, nucleocapsid (N), phosphorylated (P) and matrix (M) polypeptides, respectively, of the Paramyxoviridae. Two other polypeptides (M r 200K and 22K) were also detected, as was a glycopolypeptide of M r 97K, probably related to gp82. Tunicamycin inhibited glycosylation of gp53 and gp15 but gp82 was little affected, most glycans still being present on a glycopolypeptide of approximately 79K. This finding, indicating that gp82 has mostly O-linked glycans, considered with the mRNA profile and the molecular weight of the N protein shows that of the three genera in this family, TRTV most closely resembles the Pneumovirus genus.",1988-10-31,"Cavanagh, David; Barrett, Thomas",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

A genome-size RNA and seven subgenomic RNAs with molecular weights of approximately 3.3 × 106, 3.1 × 106, 2.6 × 106, 1.1 × 106, 1.0 × 106, 0.8 × 106 and 0.6 × 106 were detected. Comparisons of BCV intracellular RNAs with those of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) demonstrated the presence of an additional RNA for BCV, species 2a, of 3.1 × 106 daltons. BCV RNAs contain a nested-set structure similar to that of other coronaviruses. This nested-set structure would suggest that the new RNA has a capacity to encode a protein of approximately 430 amino acids. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs and genomic RNA are differentially regulated. At 4 to 8 h post-infection (p.i.), subgenomic RNAs are synthesized at a maximal rate and represent greater than 90% of the total viral RNA synthesized, whereas genome-size RNA accounts for only 7%. Later in infection, at 70 to 72 h p.i., genome-size RNA is much more abundant and accounts for 88% of total RNA synthesized. Immunoprecipitations of [35S]methionine-pulse-labeled viral proteins demonstrated that viral protein synthesis occurs early in the infection, concurrent with the peak of viral subgenomic RNA synthesis. Western blot analysis suggests that these proteins are stable since the proteins are present at high level as late as 70 to 72 h p.i. The kinetics of production of virus particles coincides with the synthesis of genomic RNA. These studies thus indicate that there is a differential temporal regulation of the synthesis of genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs, and that the synthesis of genomic RNA is the rate-limiting step regulating the production of virus particles.",1988-03-31,"Keck, James G.; Hogue, Brenda G.; Brian, David A.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

However, examination of cellular RNA using single-stranded probes revealed the presence of both ( + )sense and antisense RNA transcripts (45–70 copies per cell). In this BPV-based system the inhibitory activity appeared to be associated with a nonspecific, interferon (IFN)-mediated effect. In the second approach, an expression system was used which involved 293 cells, a chimeric human cytomegalovirus (CMV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) promoter, and methotrexate- (Mtx)-mediated gene amplification. Cells were found to express up to 7500 copies of influenza virus-specific RNA per cell at a steady state level. In this system no RNA transcripts of the opposite orientation were found.

(1991) J. Gen. Virol. 72, 579–587). Sequence analysis showed that mRNA 3 was smaller due to the presence of a new putative RNA-leader binding site upstream of the PRCV ORF-3 gene. However, this observation did not explain the deletion observed in PRCV mRNA 2. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to generate cDNA from the 3' coding region of the putative polymerase gene to the poly (A) tail of PRCV for comparison to the equivalent region from TGEV. The PRCV S protein was found to consist of 1225 amino acids, which had 98% similarity to the TGEV S protein. However, the PRCV S gene contained a 672 nucleotide deletion, corresponding to 224 amino acids (residues 21 to 245 in TGEV S protein), 59 nucleotides downstream of the S gene initiation codon. The PRCV genome from the ORF-3 gene to the poly (A) tail was sequenced for comparison to TGEV in order to identify other potential differences between the two viruses. Four ORFs were identified that showed 98% similarity to the TGEV ORF-4, M, N and ORF-7 genes. No other deletions or any PRCV specific sequences were identified.",1991-11-30,"Britton, Paul; Mawditt, Karen L.; Page, Kevin W.",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

Inoculation of various doses of the variants revealed that the cl-2 and CNSV were highly virulent and DL and DS were low-virulent, while sp-4 and JHM-X were avirulent. Pathological examination of rats infected with variants cl-2, DL and sp-4 showed that the cl-2 and DL induced severe and mild acute encephalomyelitis, respectively, while no lesions were observed in the central nervous system of rats infected with sp-4. Virus growth and distribution of antigen in rat brains correlated strongly with neurovirulence. These results suggest that S protein plays a role in neurovirulence in rats.

The biosynthesis of S and M was analyzed in the presence of tunicamycin and monensin. The effect of treatment with endoglycosidases H and F and glycopeptidase F on the precursors and mature forms of S and M were also examined. Species 175K and 29K were characterized as high mannose forms of S and M, respectively, and species 220K and 30–36K as complex type glycosylated forms of these two proteins. M was present mainly as a 29K species in mature virions whereas the 175K form of S was not detected, thus implying that the two proteins undergo Golgi modifications at a far different efficiency. Anti-S and -M monoclonal antibodies were examined for their reactivity towards polypeptide species either treated with endo H or produced in the presence of tunicamycin. It was found that (i) among the four major antigenic sites previously defined (Delmas et al., 1986), only site C (amino acids 363 to 371) was notably expressed by the unglycosylated S polypeptide 155K, whereas the three other sites were dependent upon core-glycosylation, (ii) three of the four anti-M mAbs tested did not recognize the unglycosylated M polypeptide 26K.

To better understand the molecular biology of the prototype HCV-229E strain, the nucleotide sequence of the 5'-unique regions of mRNAs 4 and 5 were determined from cloned cDNAs. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs synthesized from mRNA 4 revealed a major difference with previously published results. However, polymerase chain reaction amplification of this region showed that the sequenced cDNAs were produced from minor RNA species, an indication of possible genetic polymorphism in this region of the viral genome. The mutated messenger RNA 4 contains two ORFs: (1) ORF4a consisting of 132 nucleotides which potentially encodes a 44-amino acid polypeptide of 4653 Da; this coding sequence is preceded by a consensus transcriptional initiation sequence, CUAAACU, similar to the ones found upstream of the N and M genes; (2) ORF4b of 249 nucleotides potentially encoding an 83-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9550 Da. On the other hand, mRNA 5 contains one single ORF of 231 nucleotides which could encode a 77-amino acid basic and leucine-rich polypeptide of 9046 Da. This putative protein presents a significant degree of amino acid homology (33%) with its counterpart found in transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). The proteins in the two different viruses exhibit similar molecular weights and are extremely hydrophobic. Interestingly, a sequence homology of five amino acids was found between the protein encoded by ORF4b of HCV-229E and an immunologically important region of human myelin basic protein.",1992-02-29,"Jouvenne, Patricia; Mounir, Samir; Stewart, Janet N.; Richardson, Christopher D.; Talbot, Pierre J.",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

By using sucrose gradient centrifugation, the G1 and G2 glycoproteins in PTV-infected or recombint-transfected cells were found to sediment as dimers after DSP cross-linking, suggesting that the G1 and G2 proteins are associated as dimers by non-covalent interactions. Pulse-chase and two-dimensional gel analysis indicate that dimerization occurs between newly synthesized G1 and G2 proteins, and that a small fraction of the G2 proteins is assembled into G2 homodimers. The amounts of G1 and G2 proteins were substantially decreased, while the amounts of nucleocapsid protein remained nearly unchanged, when PTV-infected cells were treated with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, indicating that the G1 and G2 proteins are unstable if glycosylation is prevented.",1992-03-31,"Si-Yi, Chen; Yumiko, Matsuoka; Compans, Richard W.",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

(1990) Virol. 177, 768–771). The 3'-non-coding segment of 80 nucleotides of the two LDV genomes is identical, whereas marked, but varying nucleotide and amino acid divergence is apparent in the three upstream overlapping open reading frames (ORF). The third ORF from the 3'-end exhibits only 82% nucleotide and 90% amino acid identity, whereas the 3'-terminal ORF, which encodes the nucleocapsid protein, exhibits approximately 99% amino acid identity. The second 3'-terminal ORF encodes an 18.8 kDa protein which lacks N-glycosylation sites but possesses 2 or 3 potential transmembrane helices in the N-terminal half of the molecule. A similar membrane organization is observed for the corresponding protein of equine arteritis virus and the M protein of mouse hepatitis virus. The sequence analyses combined with Northern hybridization analyses of RNA from LDV-infected macrophages and spleens of LDV-infected mice indicate that the three ORFs encoded by the 3'-terminal end of the LDV genome are expressed via the three smallest mRNAs (mRNAs 6–8) of the seven subgenomic mRNAs of LDV (mRNAs 2–8), which range in size from about 0.8 to 3.6 kb. All mRNAs have been shown to carry poly(A)-tracts and a common leader sequence. The seven mRNAs were produced in infected macrophage cultures concomitantly with genomic LDV RNA. Maximum LDV RNA synthesis was observed between 6 and 8 h post-infection. The same seven subgenomic mRNAs were detected in macrophages infected with three different isolates of LDV, but different relative amounts of some of the mRNAs were produced. The relative proportions of molecules of mRNAs 1–8 present in 6 h LDV-P-infected macrophages were about 13, 5, 5, 8, 6, 11, 11 and 27% of the total, respectively.",1992-04-30,"Lili, Kuo; Zongyu, Chen; Rowland, Raymond R.R.; Faaberg, Kay S.; Plagemann, Peter G.W.",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

Overall, the nucleocapsid protein is highly variable both in size and composition between coronavirus major antigenic groups but is conserved within these groups. A phylogenetic tree of the nucleocapsid protein of various coronaviruses indicates that the coronaviruses fall into distinct groups that correspond to the three major antigenic groups; however, a phylogenetic tree of the IBV nucleocapsid shows that this does not hold true for the type specific antigenic groups of IBV.",1992-09-15,"Williams, Anna K.; Li, Wang; Sneed, Loyd W.; Collisson, Ellen W.",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

Not only was this U-rich sequence absent from the 3' non-coding region of the Mass41 strain, it was also highly variable, especially in comparison to the highly conserved 3' non coding region downstream of this sequence. Computer analyses of the sequences adjacent to this hypervariable region (HVR) showed that the 3' end of the IBV genome was highly conserved downstream of this region, with 94.3 to 97.8% similarity.

In an effort to determine which viral proteins might be determinants of enterotropism, immunoblots of MHV-Y and MHV-RI virions using anti-S, -N and -M protein-specific antisera were performed. The uncleaved MHV-Y and MHV-RI S proteins migrated slightly faster than the MHV-A59 S protein. The MHV-Y S protein was inefficiently cleaved. The MHV-Y, MHV-RI and MHV-A59 N and M proteins showed only minor differences in their migration. The S genes of MHV-Y and MHV-RI were cloned, sequenced and found to encode 1361 and 1376 amino acid long proteins, respectively. The presence of several amino acids changes upstream from the predicted cleavage site of the MHV-Y S protein may contribute its inefficient cleavage. A high degree of homology was found between the MHV-RI and MHV-4 S proteins, whereas the homology between the MHV-Y S protein and the S proteins of other MHV strains was much lower.

No free LDV 5'-leader of 156 nucleotides was detected in LDV-infected macrophages. Another mechanism, independent replication of the subgenomic mRNAs, predicts the presence of negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs in infected cells which might be generated from subgenomic mRNAs in virions. Full-length antigenomic RNA was detected in LDV-infected macrophages by Northern hybridization at a level of < 1% of that of genomic RNA, but no negative polarity subgenomic RNAs. Negative complements to all subgenomic mRNAs, however, were detected by reverse transcription of total RNA from infected macrophages using as primer an oligonucleotide complementary to the antileader followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using this sense primer in combination with various oligonucleotide primers complementary to a segment downstream of the junction between the 5' leader and the body of each subgenomic RNA. It is unclear whether these minute amounts of negative subgenomic RNAs function in the replication of the subgenomic mRNAs. They could also be by-products of the RNA replication process.

Whereas the strains within the Mass, European and Dutch strains were at least 95% homologous, the strains within the American group were most variable, sharing about 80% identity. The hypervariable region (HVR) which tended to correlate with serotype extended from amino acid residue 53 to 148. In addition to the previously described putative recombination events in the S1 gene of PP14 and SE17, we have now described similar shifts in homology in the corresponding gene of the Gray, Holte, 6/82 (European strain), and Iowa strains. Although minor cross-over sites were identified in the more conserved 3' end at approximately nt 1000 and 1400, a frequently used hot-spot for recombination extended from nt 25 to a region immediately upstream of, but not including, the hypervariable region (HVR). In addition to point mutations, deletions, and insertions, recombination often involving Mass-like and Ark-like sequences, is a commonly used mechanism responsible for the evolution of IBV.",1994-12-31,"Li, Wang; Junker, Dave; Hock, Lisa; Ebiary, Elham; Collisson, Ellen W.",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

The accumulation of the membrane glycoproteins G1 and G2 in the GC probably determines the site of maturation. Here we have studied the intracellular transport and targeting to the GC of G1 and G2 of Uukuniemi virus, a member of the Phlebovirus genus, and report on their expression from cloned cDNAs either together or separately by using a T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus expression system. When G1 and G2 were expressed together from a full-length cDNA as the p110 precursor, both proteins were localized to the Golgi complex, as evidenced by colocalization with the Golgi marker enzyme mannosidase II. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that G1 expressed alone also localized to the GC. However, pulse-chase experiments showed that G1 remained endoglycosidase H sensitive. G2 expressed alone remained associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). G2 could be rescued from the ER and transported to the GC by coexpression with G1 from separate mRNAs. Coexpression also increased the efficiency of G1 transport to the GC. With none of the constructs could the glycoproteins be observed on the cell surface. These results show that efficient export of G1 and G2 from the ER requires coexpression of both proteins, in conformity with our previous results showing that G1 and G2 from heterodimeric complexes in the ER. Since G1 expressed alone is retained in the GC, we conclude that G1 contains a retention signal for localization to the GC. G2 might thus become associated with the GC indirectly via its interaction with G1.",1995-04-30,"Melin, Lars; Persson, Robert; Andersson, Agneta; Bergström, Anita; Rönnholm, Ragna; Pettersson, Ralf F.",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

For detection and characterization of the FrC6 and A8 viruses, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the FLV complex were established. Thirty MAbs, each of which reacted with the FLV-producing cell line, were tested for potential neutralizing activities; only two MAbs inhibited the proliferation of the A8 virus. These two MAbs were ineffective or had very weak neutralizing activities toward the non-neurotropic FLV strain clone 57 virus. Further characterization of MAbs by immunoprecipitation revealed that 4 MAbs recognized the envelope protein of the A8 virus. Two of these 4 MAbs recognized the surface glycoprotein gp70, requiring the conformational epitope of the virus for this recognition, while the other two MAbs, which were reactive with the transmembrane protein p15E, were conformation-independent Both of the MAbs against gp70 distinguished neuropathogenic and non-neuropathogenic viruses to some extent, through neutralizing activity or binding activity detected by immunoprecipitation, whereas the two MAbs against p15E reacted with the viruses in a similar manner.

Reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction amplification using this set of degenerate primers yielded products of the expected size from the genomes of all three viruses. It also yielded a product of appropriate size from the genome of another strain of PRRSV (VR2332), the ORF 1b sequence of which is unknown, but the 3′ end of the genome of which differs from that of the PRRSV-LV genome by about 50%. No products were generated from the genome of simian hemorhagic fever virus (SHFV), another member of this virus group. However, an appropriate product was generated with a second set of degenerate primers which was designed from the same ORF 1b segments of LDV, EAV and PRRSV-LV as the first set but on the basis of human codon preferences. Sequence analysis showed that the amplified SHFV ORF 1b segment exhibited about 50% nucleotide identity with the corresponding segments of ORF 1b of LDV, EAV and PRRSV.

The most remarkable of these was that the mutant, designated Albany 18 (Alb 18), assembled virions devoid of the S glycoprotein at the nonpermissive temperature. Alb18 also failed to bring about syncytia formation in cells infected at the nonpermissive temperature. Virions of the mutant assembled at the permissive temperature were much more thermolabile than wild type. Moreover, mutant S protein that was incorporated into virions at the permissive temperature showed enhanced pH-dependent thermolability in its ability to bind to the MHV receptor.

In the present study, mouse LB cells were treated with various concentrations of interferon (IFN) and/or BFA overnight and infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) after removal of IFN and BFA. Doses of BFA which neither inhibit the metabolism of the cell nor the infectivity of EMCV, decreased the IFN-induced antiviral activity against EMCV as demonstrated by virus titer from supernatants. Since 2–5A synthetase and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) have been suggested to be involved in the antiviral action of IFN against EMCV, their activities were investigated in LB cells after BFA treatment. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization showed a decrease (2–3-fold) in the mRNA of 2′–5′ oligoadenylate (2–5A) synthetase after BFA treatment. BFA also inhibited the activity of 2–5A synthetase, 2–5A dependent RNase and phosphorylation of PKR in cellular extracts, indicating that BFA may be exerting its inhibitory effect both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. This study reports a new biological action of BFA, demonstrating that BFA antagonized the antiviral action of IFN by inhibiting IFN-induced enzymatic pathways. These studies also suggest that both 2–5A and PKR are important in the antiviral activity of IFN against EMCV.",1996-02-29,"Sidhu, G.S.; Singh, A.K.; Raghunath, P.N.; Sivaram, S.; Maheshwari, R.K.",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

In vitro systems developed so far have limited the growth in knowledge about RCVs by not permitting generation of plaque-cloned virus stocks, reliable isolation of RCVs from rat tissues, or growth of high titered stocks of all isolates. Due to the fact that less than 20% of L2(Percy) cells were becoming infected, sublines were produced and selected for maximal growth of RCVs. Screening of 238 cell sublines yielded L2p.176 cells which were highly susceptible to all RCVs tested; however, susceptibility declined after 30 passages in vitro. Low-passaged L2p.176 cells were used to isolate virus from natural outbreaks and to propagate individual RCV plaques into high titered stocks. Proteins from six RCV isolates were immunoblotted using polyclonal rat and mouse antibodies to sialodacryoadenitis virus and polyclonal monospecific rabbit and goat antibodies against the peplomer (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Proteins of two prototype, one Japanese and three wild type RCVs were examined and found to be similar to those of MHV, although the exact sizes and ratios of protein forms were unique for most RCV isolats. This study reports the development of a continuous cell line which reliably supports RCVs opening an opportunity for further in vivo studies of the biology of these agents. As a first step in the characterization of RCVs, we have shown that RCV proteins are very similar to those of MHV.",1996-03-31,"Gaertner, Diane J.; Compton, Susan R.; Winograd, Deborah F.; Smith, Abigail L.",Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

To initiate infection, viruses bind to sites, or receptors, on the cell surface and transfer their genome across the limiting membrane of the cell. The mechanisms underlying these events, and viral tropism for particular host cells, are becoming increasingly well understood. Several cell surface proteins have now been identified as viral receptors, and analyses of intact virus particles and sub-viral components are revealing the structures of the binding determinants on the viruses themselves. For many viruses, the events leading to penetration and delivery involve constitutive endocytic properties of the host cell, and the low pH environment in endocytic compartments is a crucial trigger in the penetration process. The knowledge of viral tropism, binding and entry suggests strategies which may be applied to the design of targeted therapeutic agents with appropriate specificities and effective delivery mechanisms.",1989-09-30,"Sommerfelt, Maja A.; Marsh, Mark",Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews,,,True,custom_license

Good progress is being made with respect to the first three steps, the other steps still provide major challenges, notably the definition of targeting elements.

Throughout evolution, animal species have been continually afflicted with devastating disease outbreaks which have influenced the demographic and genetic status of the populations. Some general population consequences of such epidemics include selection for disease resistance, the occasional alteration of host gene frequencies by a genetic ‘founder effect’ after an outbreak, and genetic adaptation of parasites to abrogate host defense mechanisms. A wide variety of host cellular genes which are polymorphic within species and which confer a regulatory effect on the outcome of infectious diseases has recently been discovered. The critical importance of maintaining genetic diversity with respect to disease defense genes in natural populations is indicated by certain populations which have reduced genetic variability and apparent increased vulnerability to infectious disease.",1988-10-31,"O'Brien, Stephen J.; Evermann, James F.",Trends in Ecology & Evolution,,,True,custom_license

The children were all aged three years or less. In each case death was preceded by an unexpected increase in ventilatory pressure requirement followed by the development of a similar pulmonary shadowing on chest radiography. The radiological abnormality was felt to be consistent with a pneumonitis associated with some small airway disease. The clustering of these deaths, occurring in a similar unusual manner, was felt to constitute an outbreak warranting investigation. An Incident Committee was established to plan and manage a large multidisciplinary investigation during which the unit was temporarily closed. Following extensive investigation no bacterium, virus, fungus or other pathogen, toxic agent, or any other explanation for the cluster of deaths could be found. The possibility that the cluster occurred by chance remains although this was felt to be unlikely.",1993-06-30,"Maguire, H.; Watson, J.; George, R.; Taylor, L.; Murray, V.; Penny, D.; Rigby, M.; Taylor, P.; Gaya, H.; Durman, L.",Journal of Hospital Infection,,,False,custom_license

Permeabilization of the synaptic plasma membranes by overnight incubation in buffer or by saponin (<0.08%) exposed an additional 30% of phosphatidylcholine to exchange, presumably from the inner cytoplasmic leaflet. Phosphatidylcholine is therefore asymmetrically distributed in the synaptosomal plasma membrane, as it is in other plasma membranes.",1993-02-28,"Shina, Ronit; Crain, Richard C.; Rosenberg, Philip; Condrea, Eleonora",Neurochemistry International,,,True,custom_license

The internal granular layer of the MOB exhibited continual growth, increasing in volume by a factor of 63% over the range of ages studied. The sizes of MOB mitral cell perikarya and nuclei, expressed either as observed cross-sectional areas or as estimated mean volumes, did not change significantly as a function of age. The numbers of mitral cells exhibiting 2 nucleoli in the plane of section decreased from about 22% in the youngest animals to about 4% in the 18- and 30-month old animals and to nil in the oldest animals. These results are discussed in relation to findings of other investigators using Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rats.

We studied 57 MS patients and 59 controls with similar age and sex distributions. In MS patients, we found the classical increased frequency of HLA-DR2, HLA-DQw1 and also an excess of Gm (3; ±23; 5*). Mumps antibody levels were higher in MS patients than in controls; elevation was not significant for measles antibodies. Analysis suggests that an association between HLA-DQwl and antibody titers against various viruses exists in controls but is absent in MS patients. In particular, we found that mumps antibody titers were higher in DQwl-positive than in DQwl-negative controls, while there was no significant difference among MS cases. Accordingly, we found that the overall difference between patients and controls was due to the fact that DQwl-positive patients had higher titers than controls, while DQwl-negative cases had similar titers as controls.

Two E1-specific CTL clones were examined for immune recognition of RV wild-type and attenuated vaccine strains and recombinant E1 protein. The exact sequence (273–284) recognized by both clones was delineated by using truncated and overlapping SPs covering these residues. The defined T-cell site overlapped almost completely with a virus neutralizing antibody-binding site previously identified with mouse monoclonal and human antibodies. A series of single aa-substituted SP analogues of E1(273–284) was used to define residues critical for T-cell recognition. Using EBV-Bl displaying different HLA-DR haplotypes and -DR4 subtypes as targets to determine MHC class II restriction elements, immune recognition by both T-cell clones was shown to be associated with HLA-DR4.

The potential of these vector vaccines lies in the hope that such a vaccine would be cheaper, safer and/or more effective than existing vaccines to some pathogens. Vaccinia virus as a vector has attracted most attention to date because: (a) several immunogenes can be inserted into its genome without destroying its infectivity; (b) the immunogens appear to be produced normally; (c) vaccinia virus has been used highly successfully to eradicate smallpox; and (d) it has a wide host-range and thus might find veterinary as well as human medical application. Experimental vaccines, successfully tested in animals, have been prepared using immunogenes from influenza virus, hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex virus. Apathogenic enteric bacteria have some potential as vectors, most probably against enteric pathogens, although the potential of viral vectors is likely to be realized first. Parasitic worms and protozoa devastate millions of people.

Attachment is followed by a redistribution or capping of virus particles on the cell surface which may play a role in the uptake process. Certain viruses penetrate the plasma membrane directly but many, both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, are endocytosed at coated pits and subsequently pass into endosomes. The low pH environment of the endosome facilitates passage of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. For some viruses the mechanism of membrane penetration is now known to be linked to a pH-mediated conformational change in external virion proteins. As a consequence of infection there are alterations in the permeability of the plasma membrane which may contribute to cellular damage. Recent advances in the understanding of these processes are reviewed and their relevance to the development of new strategies for vaccines emphasised.",1986-06-30,"Patterson, S.; Oxford, J.S.",Vaccine,,,True,custom_license

In the present report, seven diethylcarbamazine-treated cats developed higher serum antibody titres to feline infectious peritonitis more frequently than did seven untreated controls. Since feline infectious peritonitis is caused by a coronavirus, these results suggest that diethylcarbamazine treatment could be exploited for vaccination and treatment strategies for non-retroviral in addition to retroviral infections.",1988-02-29,"Kitchen, L.W.",Vaccine,,,True,custom_license

Two different vaccine trials were conducted. In a small-scale experimental trial, involving 21 pregnant cows (13 vaccinated and eight unvaccinated controls), a significant increase in neutralizing antibody titres against different serotypes of bovine rotaviruses was found in both the colostrum and serum of vaccinated cows compared with that of unvaccinated controls. Seven days after birth, half of the calves born to vaccinated dams or to control cows were challenged with live virulent virus whereas the other half of both groups were left in contact with the infected calves in order to mimic a natural field challenge. Although no statistically significant differences in the rate of protection were observed among the different groups of animals, a larger number of vaccinated calves were protected in comparison with their controls, particularly where animals in contact with infected calves were concerned. Secondly, a large-scale field trial was carried out in 17 beef herds involving a total of 4066 vaccinated pregnant cows. In 11 farms morbidity and mortality in calves from vaccinated cows were compared with historical data from the previous 3 years at the same locations. In the other six herds, control groups were used to compare data of the same year: 1540 cows were vaccinated and 2700 were left as controls. Taking into account the previous and current incidence of diarrhoea, morbidity and mortality were significantly reduced in 16 of the 17 beef herds tested. Vaccine effectiveness was also evident in farms where other enteropathogens such as cryptosporidium and coronaviruses were present, together with rotavirus.",1989-06-30,"Bellinzoni, R.C.; Blackhall, J.; Baro, N.; Auza, N.; Mattion, N.; Casaro, A.; La Torre, J.L.; Scodeller, E.A.",Vaccine,,,True,custom_license

Seventeen of 20 vaccinated cats (85%) survived a rigorous virulent FIPV challenge that caused FIP in 12 of 12 non-vaccinated cats (100%), 10 (83%) of which died. Intranasal vaccination stimulated serum IgG and serum and salivary IgA antibody responses (measured by ELISA), FIPV-neutralizing antibody (VN), and a cell-mediated immune (CMI) response as measured by lymphocyte proliferation. The serum antibody response to vaccination was not associated with protection. In fact, the IgG, IgA and VN titres were much higher in control cats than in vaccinated cats following challenge suggesting an immune-mediated pathogenesis. In contrast, stimulation of a mucosal IgA response to vaccination was related to protection. The in vitro proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to virulent FIPV was observed in vaccinated cats, in vaccinated and challenged cats but not in non-vaccinated challenged cats.",1990-12-31,"Gerber, J.D.; Ingersoll, J.D.; Gast, A.M.; Christianson, K.K.; Selzer, N.L.; Landon, R.M.; Pfeiffer, N.E.; Sharpee, R.L.; Beckenhauer, W.H.",Vaccine,,,True,custom_license

In The Netherlands, vaccination against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is performed with vaccines that contain several life-attenuated virus strains. These highly effective vaccines may create ideal conditions for recombination, and could therefore be dangerous in the long term. This paper addresses the question of the frequency of recombination of avian coronavirus IBV in the field. A method was sought to detect and quantify recombination from sequence data. Nucleotide sequences of eight IBV isolates in a region of the genome suspected to contain recombination, were aligned and compared. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for different sections of this region. Differences in topology between these trees were observed, suggesting that in three out of eight strains in vivo RNA recombinant had occurred.",1990-12-31,"Kusters, J.G.; Jager, E.J.; Niesters, H.G.M.; van der Zeijst, B.A.M.",Vaccine,,,True,custom_license

Next, we studied the role of the expressed nucleocapsid protein in induction of a protective immune response to IBV in chickens. Chickens were primed with nucleocapsid protein and subsequently boosted with inactivated IBV, strain M41. Proliferative responses of blood mononuclear cells corresponded with increased mean haemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization titres. Finally, an increased tracheal protection against challenge with live IBV was observed.

Such vaccines are practical and effective because (1) most fatal ETEC infections in farm animals occur in the early neonatal period when the antibody titres in colostrum and milk are highest; (2) more than 90% of the ETEC in farm animals belong to a small family of fimbrial antigen types: (3) fimbriae consist of good protein antigens on the bacterial surface where they are readily accessible to antibody; (4) fimbriae are required for a critical step (adhesion-colonization) early in the pathogenesis of the disease. ETEC infections continue to be a significant clinical problem in farm animals in spite of extensive use of fimbriae-based vaccines. Definitive data on the efficacy of the commercial vaccines in field use are not available. The prevailing perception among animal health professionals is that the vaccines are effective, that the problem occurs chiefly among non-vaccinated animals, and that in some herds vaccination moves peak prevalence of disease from the first to the second or third week after birth, when mortality is lower. It has been suggested that extensive use of vaccines will rapidly select for the emergence of novel or previously low prevalence fimbrial antigen types. There is no evidence that this has happened after a decade of routine vaccine use in the United States. However, there is no active direct surveillance for such emergence. In contrast to the rational development of vaccines to provide passive lacteal protection against ETEC in suckling neonates, comparatively little progress has been made in providing the knowledge required for development of vaccines to protect against postweaning ETEC infections in swine.",1993-12-31,"Moon, Harley W.; Bunn, Thomas O.",Vaccine,,,True,custom_license

Whereas TGEV-immune pigs were completely protected against challenge, all PRCV-immune pigs showed serological evidence of TGEV replication. Nevertheless, the aerosol or intragastric inoculation with PRCV primed the humoral immune system against TGEV and the TGEV challenge induced a secondary antibody response in most PRCV-immune pigs. Furthermore, all PRCV-immune pigs showed a decrease in the duration of the excretion of infectious TGEV (0–4 days) in comparison with the duration of the virus excretion by seronegative pigs (5–6 days).",1993-12-31,"Cox, E.; Pensaert, M.B.; Callebaut, P.",Vaccine,,,True,custom_license

The role of the Fc fragment of this antibody as well as the involvement of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytolysis towards protection was evaluated in vivo. Passive immunization with the Fab fragment alone (618–907 μg mouse−1) was unable to confer protection in mice. Furthermore, we passively immunized with the mAb 18A2B2 SCID beige mice, which are deficient in natural killer (NK) cell activity, to ascertain the role of NK cells in the protective mechanism. These mice were free of virus 5 days following viral challenge, indicating that NK cells do not contribute significantly towards the protective action of this antibody. Moreover, passively immunized BALB c mice decomplemented with 8–10 U of cobra venom factor (CoVF) and DBA 2J mice (C5 deficient) were only partially protected. These findings suggest that in mice the alternative and classical pathways of the complement system are involved in the passive protection mechanism conferred by the non-neutralizing mAb 18A2B2. To our knowledge, it is the first description of a protective mechanism in mice that involves a non-neutralizing antibody and the complement system.",1996-04-30,"Corbeil, Serge; Seguin, Cecile; Trudel, Michel",Vaccine,,,True,custom_license

Their functional roles include the hydrolysis of several biologically active peptides and growth factors and some have proved to be of diagnostic and prognostic value in leukaemia. These enzymes may also be found in serum as a consequence of non-haematopoietic related diseases and so have been used as indicators of liver damage. Haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow go through a process of growth and differentiation before being released into the peripheral circulation where they fulfill many functional roles. The enzyme activities of some aminopeptidases have been shown to modulate the growth of these cells. In addition, the activities of these enzymes themselves can be regulated by haematopoietic growth factors. However, the mechanisms that regulate their expression and activity are not fully understood.

Alteration of these structures may be induced in the course of various pathological events and provoke important perturbations of liver function. We demonstrate here that sinusoidal endothelial cells are permissive for mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) in vivo and in vitro and that this infection leads to a striking decrease in the number of fenestrae. The disappearance of these structures observed under scanning electron microscopy or in cryofracture preparations in vivo and in vitro cannot be reversed by the action of cytochalasin B on the microfilament network. The decrease in the porosity seems to be related directly to the productive infection of the endothelial cells, because it was not observed in A/J mice resistant to the virus and in susceptible BALB/c mice immunized with a thermosensitive mutant in which no viral replication occurs.

Rats and hamsters were exposed by inhalation to 0, 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm of methylene chloride for 6 hr per day, 5 days a week, for 2 years. No exposure-related cytogenetic effects were present in male or female rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. Females rats exposed to 3500 ppm had an increased mortality rate while female hamsters exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm had decreased mortality rates. Carboxyhemoglobin values were elevated in rats and hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm with the percentage increase in hamsters greater than in rats. Minimal histopathologic effects were present in the livers of rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. Decreased amyloidosis was observed in the liver and other organs in hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. While the number of female rats with a benign tumor was not increased, the total number of benign mammary tumors was increased in female rats in an exposure-related manner. This effect was also evident in male rats in the 1500- and 3500-ppm exposure groups. Finally, male rats exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm had an increased number of sercomas in the ventral neck region located in or around the salivary glands. Therefore, in this 2-year study, some effects were observed in male and female rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm of methylene chloride.

Two-week repeated and 13-week subchronic inhalation exposures of F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice to ADA were conducted to determine the toxicity of inhaled ADA. The mean air concentrations of ADA in the 2-week studies were 207, 102, 52, 9.4, or 2.0 mg/m3. No exposure-related mortality nor abnormal clinical signs were observed in rats or mice during or after exposure. The terminal body weights were slightly depressed in the highest exposure group. Liver weights were lower in male rats exposed to 200 mg ADA/m3. No significant lesions were noted on either gross or histologic evaluation of rats or mice. In the 13-week subchronic study, the mean air concentrations of ADA were 204, 100, or 50 mg/m3. No mortality or clinical signs related to exposure were observed. The terminal body weights of exposed rats were not significantly different from those of control rats but were significantly depressed in mice exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. No histopathological lesions were noted in mice. Lung weights were increased and enlarged mediastinal and/or tracheobronchial lymph nodes were noted in rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3. No exposure-related lesions were observed microscopically in rats exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. All rats in the 50 mg DNA/m3 exposure group only had lung lesions that consisted of perivascular cuffing with lymphocytes and a multifocal type II cell hyperplasia, suggesting a possible immune reaction to an antigen in the lung. Viral titers for rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3 were negative for Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice, which produce similar lesions. The possibility of an unknown viral antigen causing this lesion cannot be eliminated. Lung tissue from male rats was analyzed for ADA and biurea, the major metabolite of ADA. No ADA was detected. The amount of biurea in the lungs increased nonlinearly with increasing exposure concentration, suggesting that clearance was somewhat impaired with repeated exposures. However, even at the highest exposure concentration, this amount of biurea was less than 1% of the estimated total ADA deposited over the exposure period. In summary, ADA is rapidly cleared from the lungs, even when inhaled at concentrations up to 200 mg/m3.

Continual refinement of animal toxicity and carcinogenesis studies, however, can be an effective means of reducing the numbers of animals used and conserving time and resources without compromising scientific quality. We must continue to strive to find species and strains that can metabolize chemicals similar to humans, are small enough to be housed in large numbers, and have low prevalence of spontaneous lesions with sufficient life span to express the toxic and carcinogenic potential of chemicals. Adequate care of animals with control of variables such as light, temperature, diet, bedding, diseases, and genetic characters of laboratory animals will decrease the variability. Humane considerations and euthanasia of animals with large masses and other conditions interfering with eating and drinking, major injuries and ulcers related to husbandry and treatment, and diseases indicating pain and suffering will help not only to alleviate further pain and distress but also to facilitate collection of tissues without secondary complications for detection of chemical treatment-related lesions. Limiting the duration of studies to decrease the variability due to ageassociated changes will also refine long-term studies. Other considerations for refinement of carcinogenesis studies include selection of the most sensitive sex of one or more species for evaluation of selected chemicals in a class where toxic and carcinogenic potential of other representative chemicals are known. Genetically engineered animal models with known oncogenes may reduce the duration and increase the sensitivity of carcinogenesis studies with a reduction in the use of animals.",1990-07-31,"Rao, Ghanta N.; Huff, James",Fundamental and Applied Toxicology,,,True,custom_license

In this study, we exposed tracheal organ cultures from rats to 95% oxygen and 1 ppm ozone, alone and in combination, to determine (1) whether epithelial responses to ozone similar to those observed in vivo occur in airways separated from systemic physiologic, secretory, and inflammatory reactions; (2) whether concentrations of oxygen sufficient to potentially cause oxidant injury result in morphologic epithelial alterations similar to those that occur in ozone toxicity; and (3) if the combined oxidant insult of oxygen and ozone results in more severe damage to the tracheal epithelium than occurs with ozone in air. Tracheal organ cultures were exposed to filtered air and 5% carbon dioxide; filtered air, 5% carbon dioxide, and 1 ppm ozone; 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide; or 95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 1 ppm ozone for 96 hr. Light- and quantitative electron-microscopic evaluation showed that epithelia to 1 ppm ozone in air exhibited loss of ciliated cells and ciliated cell damage. The epithelia exposed to 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide were pseudostratified, columnar, ciliated, and hyperplastic. Epithelia exposed to 95% oxygen plus 1 ppm ozone were stratified and nonciliated or very sparsely ciliated. The predominant cell types in epithelia exposed to oxygen plus ozone were serous cells and metaplastic cells, and focal aggregates of adherent necrotic cells were present.

A response model was developed from previous results and tested in groups of rats exposed to electric fields at various field strengths. Female rats were mated, and sperm-positive animals randomly distributed among four groups: sham-exposed or exposed to 10, 65, or 130 kV/m, 60-Hz vertical electric fields. Animals were exposed for 19 hr/day throughout the experiment. During gestation, exposure to the higher field strengths resulted in slightly depressed weight gains of dams. Offspring were born in the field and remained with their dams through the suckling period. Numbers of pups per litter and pup mortality did not differ among the exposure groups. Dams exposed at 65 kV/m lost slightly more weight through the lactation period than the control group. Male pups exposed to higher field strengths gained slightly less weight from 4 to 21 days of age than did sham-exposed animals. At weaning, two F1 females per litter (randomly selected) continued on the same exposure regimen were mated at 11 weeks of age to unexposed males, and euthanized at 20 days of gestation. Uterine contents were evaluated, and all liver fetuses were weighed and examined for external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. Fertility and gestational weight gain of F1 females were not affected by exposure, nor was prenatal viability or fetal body weight. No significant increase in the incidence of litters with malformations was observed. Although no developmental toxicity was detected, exposures produced physical changes in the dams, evidenced as a rust-colored deposit on the muzzle and ears (chromodacryorrhea) that increased in incidence and severity at 65 and 130 kV/m. Incidence of chromodacryorrhea was not significantly different between sham-exposed rats and those exposed at 10 kV/m.",1990-04-30,"Rommereim, D.N.; Rommereim, R.L.; Sikov, M.R.; Buschbom, R.L.; Anderson, L.E.",Fundamental and Applied Toxicology,,,True,custom_license

It is of particular interest because of its structural similarities to other metallocenes that have been shown to be carcinogenic. F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, and 40 mg ferrocene vapor/m3, 6 hr/day for 2 weeks. During these exposures, there were no mortality and no observable clinical signs of ferrocene-related toxicity in any of the animals. At the end of the exposures, male rats exposed to the highest level of ferrocene had decreased body-weight gains relative to the weight gained by filtered air-exposed control rats, while body-weight gains for all groups of both ferrocene- and filtered air-exposed female rats were similar. Male mice exposed to the highest level of ferrocene also had decreased body-weight gains, relative to controls, while female mice had relative decreases in body-weight gains at the three highest exposure levels. Male rats had a slight decrease in relative liver weight at the highest level of exposure, whereas no relative differences in organ weights were seen in female rats. Male mice had exposure-relative decreases in liver and spleen weights, and an increase in thymus weights, relative to controls. For female mice, relative decreases in organ weights were seen for brain, liver, and spleen. No exposure-related gross lesions were seen in any of the rats or mice at necropsy. Histopathological examination was done only on the nasal turbinates, lungs, liver, and spleen. The only exposure-related finding was histopathologic lesions in the nasal turbinates of both species. These lesions were primarily centered in the olfactory epithelium and were morphologically diagnosed as subacute, necrotizing inflammation. Nasal lesions were observed in all ferrocene-exposed animals and differed only in severity, which was dependent on the exposure concentration. In vitro metabolism studies of ferrocene showed that nasal tissue, particularly the olfactory epithelium, had ∼ 10 times higher “ferrocene hydroxylating” activity than did liver tissue from the same animals. These results suggest that the mechanism of ferrocene toxicity may be the intracellular release of ferrous ion through ferrocene metabolism, followed by iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes.",1991-07-31,"Sun, J.D.; Dahl, A.R.; Gillett, N.A.; Barr, E.B.; Crews, M.L.; Eidson, A.F.; Bechtold, W.E.; Burt, D.G.; Dieter, M.P.; Hobbs, C.H.",Fundamental and Applied Toxicology,,,True,custom_license

No effects were noted at medium or low exposures. The minimal changes noted were reversible, using a subgroup of animals kept without further treatment for an additional 14 days. Overall, the end-points used in the study demonstrated that there was no detectable biological activity of ADSS at typical or even 10-fold ETS concentrations and that the activity was only minimal at very exaggerated concentrations (particle concentrations 100 times higher than typical real-world concentrations).",1992-07-31,"Coggins, Christopher R.E.; Ayres, Paul H.; Mosberg, Arnold T.; Ogden, Michael W.; Sagartz, John W.; Hayes, A.Wallace",Fundamental and Applied Toxicology,,,True,custom_license

Bacterial gene mutation assays with Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium were negative in all tester strains. In vitro chromosomal aberration assays were positive on CHO cells but negative on human lymphocytes. Moreover, HCFC-141b was negative in vivo in a mouse micronucleus inhalation assay. On the basis of these data and previously reported genotoxicity testing, HCFC-141b is considered non-genotoxic. Groups of 80 male and 80 female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed, by inhalation (6 hr/day, 5 days/wk) to vapours of HCFC-141b for 104 wk at target concentrations of 0 (control), 1500, 5000 and 20,000 ppm (increased from 15,000 ppm after 17 wk of exposure). No exposure-related effects of toxicological significance were noted with respect to survival, clinical signs, ophthalmoscopy, haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis or organ weight analysis. Reduced food intake and body weight gain were noted in both sexes of the 15,000 ppm group during the first 16 wk; thereafter, body weight gains in all groups were similar although the intergroup differences in body weight remained evident. Reduced food intake persisted in both sexes through wk 52 and in females during the second year of exposure. Treatment-related effects on macroscopic pathology were confined to increased incidences of testicular masses and altered appearance. Microscopic pathology examinations confirmed the testes as the target organ with findings of increased incidences of benign interstitial cell tumours and hyperplasia at 5000 and 20,000 ppm. The no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was 1500 ppm.

The available sequence corresponds to the part of the genome (total length > 20 kb) expressed through subgenomic mRNAs. The 5 subgenomic and the genomic RNA species detected in TGEV-infected cells form a 3′-coterminal ‘nested’ structure, a unique feature of Coronaviridae. The transcription initiation site of the TGEV subgenomic RNAs appears to involve the hexameric sequence 5′CTAAAC, which is present upstream from each coding region. In addition to the previously identified genes encoding the three structural proteins, E2, E1 and N, two regions, X1 and X2, corresponding to the non-overlapping portion of mRNAs 4 and 3, may code for so far unidentified non-structural polypeptides. The predicted X1 polypeptide (9.2 kDa) is highly hydrophobic. The sequence of the X2 region allows the translation of two non-ovelapping products, i.e., X2a (7.7 kDa).and x2b (18.8 kDa).

Thus some clues about the role of protein-bound carbohydrate can be obtained by comparing the biochemical fates and functions of glycosylated proteins with their non-glycosylated counterparts, or with proteins exhibiting differences in the type of oligosaccharide side chains. Cells infected with enveloped viruses are good systems for studying both aspects of protein glycosylation, since they contain a limited number of different glycoproteins, often with well-defined functions. Tunicamycin, and antibiotic, as well as several sugar analogues have been found to act as inhibitors of protein glycosylation by virtue of their anti-viral properties. They interfere with various steps in the dolichol pathway resulting in a lack of functional-linked oligosaccharide precursors. Compounds that interfere with oligosaccharide trimming represent a second generation of inhibitors of glycosylation. They are glycosidase inhibitors that interfere with the processing glucosidases and mannosidases and, as a result, the conversion of high-mannose into complex-type oligosaccharides is blocked. Depending upon the compound used, glycoproteins contain glucosylated-high-mannose, high-mannose or hybrid oligosaccharide structures instead of complex ones. The biological consequences of the alterations caused by the inhibitors are manifold: increased susceptibility to proteases, improper protein processing and misfolding of polypeptide chains, loss of biological activity and alteration of the site of virus-budding, to name but a few.",1988-11-30,"McDowell, William; Schwarz, Ralph T.",Biochimie,,,True,custom_license

Full length POMC was mutated by deleting amino acids 2–26 from the N-terminal region. Analysis of Neuro-2a cells expressing this mutation compared to wild type POMC indicated that these 26 amino acids contain information essential for sorting POMC to the regulated secretory pathway.

In the present review, the potential usefulness of monoclonal antibodies in animal production - with emphasis on reproduction - is discussed, including the inherent limitations of the current technology and the improvements that can be foreseen within the next few years. Because of their unique specificity and the fact that they can be produced in virtually unlimited quantities, monoclonal antibodies are an important tool in diagnostics. However, the use of these antibodies does not always guarantee absolute specificity, and the low affinity of many monoclonal antibodies will impose a number of limitations on their use. Monoclonal antibodies can also be used to optimize physiological processes such as growth and reproduction. For this, homologous antibodies will probably offer several advantages over their murine counterparts in terms of effectiveness for passive immunization. Some success has already been achieved in the development of monoclonal antibodies from livestock species. Finally, it is shown that monoclonal antibodies are becoming extremely powerful research tools.",1988-06-30,"Booman, P.",Livestock Production Science,,,True,custom_license

The aim was to find out a method for a quantitative evaluation of the health level in farms selling young breeders. An exhaustive protocol was prepared for data collection. The sources of information were clinical inspections on the farms, meat inspection data at slaughter and laboratory investigations. Data processing issued in the selection of a profile made of 14 prevailing health indicators. These were then associated so as to set up a health index with an overall score. In a second phase, the relevance of the method with respect to disease transmission was assessed. The principle was a contact challenge within totally controlled facilities between SPF pigs hysterectomy-derived and gilts taken from farms with different health scores as previously checked. The contact lasted for 28 days. Eleven farms were chosen and in every one of them 7 gilts were sampled and 10 SPF pigs were assigned to each of these farms. All the pigs were submitted to a detailed observation. At the end of it the pigs were euthanized at the laboratory and checked to find out any lesions and infectious agents. A wide range of symptoms appeared among the SPF pigs. Mortality rate was 14.6%. Pneumonia affected 23.7% of them. A relationship was found between the germ transfer and the severity of the troubles. The degree of illness in SPF pigs was clearly related to the score obtained previously in the corresponding farms.

Not in the least because one of the major stumbling blocks of immunomodulation through active vaccination, the inherent low immunogenicity of ‘self’ antigens, has in a number of other cases been solved.

Eight species of Eimeria, and Isospora suis, were recovered. In their descending order of predominance in the pigs raised on concrete, the species of coccidia were E. debliecki (26.7%), E. scabra (22.4%), E. neodebliecki (19.8%), E. porci (15.5%), E. suis (11.6%), E. polita (8.6%), E. perminuta (7%), E. spinosa (5.6%) and E. suis (3.9%). The first five species listed above predominated in the village pigs as well. E. polita, E. spinosa and I. suis were not found in the wild boar. I. suis oocysts prevailed in 8.3% of the 36 sows on concrete, and in 11.1% ( 3 27 ) of those which were positive for coccidia. Isosporoid oocysts were absent in the village sows. Of the 125 <24-day-old piglets, 29.6% were diarrhoeic, and of these, 43.2% were positive for coccidia. Four of the 16 (25%) coccidia-positive, diarrhoeic piglets, and four of the 37 (10.8%) coccidia-positive non-diarrhoeic piglets shed I. suis oocysts, an observation which seems to weaken the present contention that I. suis is the primary causative agent of neonatal porcine occidiosis. The highest mean number of oocysts per gram faeces (23 550) was recorded from the diarrhoeic farm piglets on conrete, and the lowest of 6,100 from the gestating farm sows. Mean opg data revealed very little significant quantitative variation between the corresponding age groups of the free-ranging village pigs and the commercially-farmed ones.

A monoclonal antibody with a high affinity against an oocyst antigen was used to set up the test. The efficiency of this assay was compared with that of the flotation test; 275 calf faecal samples were examined by the two methods. There was 96% agreement between the two tests. For the 11 conflicting samples, the two tests were repeated and a modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining was performed on faecal smears. All these 11 samples contained few oocysts, but only five and six of them were shown to be positive by the ELISA and flotation tests, respectively. The degree of sensitivity of the ELISA and flotation tests is comparable; samples heavily or moderately contaminated with oocysts are detected by both methods. This ELISA is reliable and never gives rise to false positive results. Nevertheless, as with the flotation test, the occasional case containing very few oocysts will not always be detected by this test. If necessary, very accurate diagnosis can be made by a staining technique or by a direct immunofluorescent assay. In veterinary medicine, the ELISA seems to be a method of choice; it appears to be a fast and reliable technique which could be used as a routine test for the detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Nevertheless the degree of sensitivity must always be borne in mind.

Twenty 2-day-old calves, divided into four groups, were orally inoculated with 1 × 106 oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum. The infected control group was unmedicated whereas the three other groups were medicated with the drug at 30, 60 and 120 μg kg−1 day−1, respectively, for 7 days, from Day (D) 2 to D8 post-inoculation (D 0 was inoculation day). The calves were weighed twice weekly and disease development and drug efficacy were assessed daily from D0 to D30 from consistency of feces, shedding of oocysts and mortality. Experimental C. parvum infection caused a severe clinical disease with profuse watery diarrhea, high oocyst shedding and mortality (3 out of 5) in the unmedicated group. The results clearly demonstrated the efficacy of halofuginone lactate in reducing the severity of clinical cryptosporidiosis. This efficacy was dose-dependent. The lowest dose (30 μg kg−1 day−1) was not able to prevent clinical disease and mortality (3 out of 5). No clinical signs were observed with the 60 and 120 μg kg−1 day−1 doses, but the animals shed oocysts after drug withdrawal. This shedding was more delayed the higher the dose of drug administered, but the delayed shedding had no effect on the growth of the animals.",1993-01-31,"Naciri, Muriel; Mancassola, Roselyne; Yvoré, P.; Peeters, J.E.",Veterinary Parasitology,,,True,custom_license

Boophilus microplus infestation caused a marginal decrease in the percentage of T lymphocytes in PBL, which was observed in both lightly (5000 larvae) and heavily (40 000 larvae) infested cattle, and began at the second infestation and continued until the end of the fourth infestation. The percentage of B lymphocytes in heavily tick-infested cattle was less than that in non-infested control cattle after the fourth infestation. The response of PBL from tick-infested cattle to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was always less than that of tick-free cattle after the second infestation. No noteworthy differences were detected between the three stages of tick infestation, that is, 1 week before the peak of adult engorgement, the middle of the peak and 1 week after all ticks had dropped. Boophilus microplus saliva (100 μl ml−1) suppressed 47% of the response of bovine PBL to PHA in vitro. This suppressive effect of saliva may contribute to the lowerresponsiveness of PBL from tick-infested cattle. Antibody production by tick-infested cattle was examined during the third and fourth heavy tick infestation.

When resampled, the overall infection rate of normal and diarrheic calves was 82.4% in April, and 40.0% in August after the diarrhea subsided. Positive calves ranged from 11 to 164 days of age, and 22.2% of them were as young as 1 to 3 weeks of age. Eight of nine diarrheic calves (88.8%) on the first farm had Cryptosporidium infection. Lower infection rates (<30%) were found on the second farm. Six of 10 positive calves were 11–22 days old, three were 164–177 days old, and one was 71 days old. Five of these 10 positive calves were also positive for Giardia infection. Five diarrheic calves on the northern Ohio farm and one diarrheic calf on the central Ohio farm were treated with metronidazole after failing to respond to antibiotic therapy. Clinical improvement was observed in all calves within 48 h after the start of treatment.

1285,b0b146d5b2ece0d2ea1816c2ed9443d29602aa51,Elsevier,"Alteration of intracellular traffic by monensin; mechanism, specificity and relationship to toxicity",10.1016/0304-4157(90)90008-Z,,2160275.0,els-covid,"Abstract Monensin, a monovalent ion-selective ionophore, facilitates the transmembrane exchange of principally sodium ions for protons. The outer surface of the ionophore-ion comples is composed largely of nonpolar hydrocarbon, which imparts a high solubility to the complexes in nonpolar solvents. In biological systems, these complexes are freely soluble in the lipid components of membranes and, presumably, diffuse or shuttle through the membranes from one aqueous membrane interface to the other. The net effect for monensin is a trans-membrane exchange of sodium ions for protons. However, the interaction of an ionophore with biological membranes, and its ionophoric expression, is highly dependent on the biochemical configuration of the membrane itself. One apparent consequence of this exchange is the neutralization of acidic intracellular compartments such as the trans Golgi apparatus cisternae and associated elements, lysosomes, and certain endosomes. This is accompanied by a disruption of trans Golgi apparatus cisternae and of lysosome and acidic endosome function. At the same time, Golgi apparatus cisternae appear to swell, presumably due to osmotic uptake of water resulting from the inward movement of ions. Monensin effects on Golgi apparatus are observed in cells from a wide range of plant and animal species. The action of monensin is most often exerted on the trans half of the stacked cisternae, often near the point of exit of secretory vesicles at the trans face of the stacked cisternae, or, especially at low monensin concentrations or short exposure times, near the middle of the stacked cisternae. The effects of monensin are quite rapid in both animal and plant cells; i.e., changes in Golgi apparatus may be observed after only 2–5 min of exposure. It is implicit in these observations that the uptake of osmotically active cations is accompanied by a concomitant efflux of H+ and that a net influx of protons would be required to sustain the ionic exchange long enough to account for the swelling of cisternae observed in electron micrographs. In the Golgi apparatus, late processing events such as terminal glycosylation and proteolytic cleavages are most susceptible to inhibition by monensin. Yet, many incompletely processed molecules may still be secreted via yet poorly understood mechanisms that appear to bypass the Golgi apparatus. In endocytosis, monensin does not prevent internalization. However, intracellular degradation of internalized ligands may be prevented. It is becoming clear that endocytosis involves both acidic and non-acidic compartments and that monensin inhibits those processes that normally occur in acidic compartments. Thus, monensin, which is capable of collapsing Na+ and H+ gradients, has gained wide-spread acceptance as a tool for studying Golgi apparatus function and for localizing and identifying the molecular pathways of subcellular vesicular traffic involving acid compartments. Among its advantages are the low concentrations at which inhibitions are produced (0.01–1.0 μM), a minimum of troublesome side effects (e.g., little or no change of protein synthesis or ATP levels) and a reversible action. Because the affinity of monensin for Na+ is ten times that for K+, its nearest competitor, monensin mediates primarily a Na+-H+ exchange. Monensin has little tendency to bind calcium. Not only is monensin of importance as an experimental tool, it is of great commercial value as a coccidiostat for poultry and to promote more efficient utilization of feed in cattle. The mechanisms by which monensin interact with coccidia and rumen microflora to achieved these benefits are reasonably well documented. However, the interactions between monensin and the tissues of the host animal are not well understood although the severe toxicological manifestations of monensin poisoning are well known. Equine species are particularly susceptible to monensin poisoning, and a common effect of monensin poisoning is vacuolization and/or swelling of mitochondria in striated muscle. Other pathological injuries to striated muscle, spleen, lung, liver and kidney also have been noted. A consistent observation is cardiac myocyte degeneration as well as vacuolization. Differences in cellular response resulting from exposure to monensin (i.e., Golgi apparatus swelling in cultured cells, isolated tissues, and plants vs.mitochondrial swelling in animals fed monensin) suggest that myocardial damage is due either to a monensin metabolite or is a secondary response to some other derivation. However, as pointed out by Bergen and Bates [26], the underlying mode of action of ionophores is on transmembrane ion fluxes which dissipate cation and proton gradients. Consequently, some or all of the observed monensin effects in vivo in animals could be secondary phenomena caused by disruption of normal membrane physiology resulting from altered ion fluxes.",1990-05-07,"Mollenhauer, Hilton H.; James Morré, D.; Rowe, Loyd D.",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Reviews on Biomembranes,,,True,custom_license

We report here an injury to the serotoninergic neurons after intranasal infection in 12-day-old rats with a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus. The brain infection was focal and transient. Viral antigens could no longer be detected 13–15 days after infection.

The neocortex was histologically intact and parameters related to other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, GABA and acetylcholine showed no marked changes.

The validity of this classical conclusion has recently been questioned by the demonstration of axonal demyelination. In addition, axons are submitted to a profound alteration of their glial environment. This work was, therefore, undertaken to reassess axonoglial interactions over time after an excitotoxic lesion in the rat. Ultrastructural studies were carried out in the ventrobasal thalamus two days to 18 months after neuronal depletion by in situ injections of kainic acid. In some cases, lemniscal afferents were identified by using anterograde transport of wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase from the dorsal column nuclei. Two and four days after kainate injection, numerous dying axons displaying typical signs of Wallerian degeneration were observed in a neuropile characterized by the loss of neuronal somata and dendrites, an increase in number of microglia/macrophages and the disappearance of astrocytes. Ten and 12 days after kainate injection, degenerating axons were no longer observed although myelin degeneration of otherwise unaltered axons was ongoing with an accumulation of myelin remnants in the neuropile. At 16 and 20 days, the demyelination process was apparently complete and axons of different diameters were sometimes packed together. One and two months after kainate injection, the axonal environment changed again: remyelination of large-caliber axons occurred at the same time as reactive astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and numerous Schwann cells appeared in the tissue. Schwann cell processes surrounded aggregates of axons of diverse calibers, ensheathed small ones and myelinated larger ones. Axons were also remyelinated by oligodendrocytes. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled lemniscal afferents could be myelinated by either of the two cell types. After three months, the neuropile exhibited an increase in number of hypertrophied astrocytes and the progressive loss of any other cellular or axonal element. At this stage, remaining Schwann cells were surrounded by a glia limitans formed by astrocytic processes. These data indicate that although excitotoxins are sparing the axons, they are having a profound and complex effect on the axonal environment. Demyelination occurs over the first weeks, accompanying the loss of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Axonal ensheathment and remyelination takes place in a second period, associated with the reappearance of oligodendrocytes and recruitment of numerous Schwann cells, while reactive astrocytes appear in the tissue at a slightly later time. Over the following months, astrocytes occupy a greater proportion of the neuron-depleted territory and other elements decrease in number. These successive stages in alteration of axonoglial interactions seem to evolve in parallel to the changes in density and terminal morphology that we described earlier for myelinated afferent fibers to the excitotoxic lesion.",1992-11-30,"Dusart, I.; Marty, S.; Peschanski, M.",Neuroscience,,,True,custom_license

In this study, the pathways utilized by two such viruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 and mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM, were compared using in situ hybridization following inoculation into either the nasal cavity or the main olfactory bulb of the mouse. The results indicate that both viruses spread to infect a unique and only partially overlapping set of connections of the main olfactory bulb. Both quantitative and qualitative differences were observed in the patterns of infection of known primary and secondary main olfactory bulb connections. Using immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase combined with in situ hybridization, it was shown that only herpes simplex virus infected noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. In contrast, both viruses infected dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, although mouse hepatitis virus produced a more widespread infection in the A10 group, as well as infecting A8 and A9. The results suggest that differential virus uptake in specific neurotransmitter systems contributes to the pattern of viral spread, although other factors, such as differences in access to particular synapses on infected cells and differences in the distribution of the cellular receptor for the two viruses, are also likely to be important. The data show that neural tracing with different viruses may define unique neural pathways from a site of inoculation.

While this phenomenon is found in many different species, its function is obscure. Understanding the molecular profile characteristic of reactive astrocytes should help define their function. The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of molecules whose levels of expression differentiate activated from resting astrocytes and to use the molecular profile of reactive astrocytes as the basis for speculations on the functions of these cells. At present, reactive astrocytosis is defined primarily as an increase in the number and size of cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein. In vivo, this increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells reflects predominantly phenotypic changes of resident astroglia rather than migration or proliferation of such cells. Upon activation, astrocytes upmodulate the expression of a large number of molecules. From this molecular profile it becomes apparent that reactive astrocytes may benefit the injured nervous system by participating in diverse biological processes. For example, upregulation of proteases and protease inhibitors could help remodel the extracellular matrix, regulate the concentration of different proteins in the neuropil and clear up debris from degenerating cells. Cytokines are key mediators of immunity and inflammation and could play a critical role in the regulation of the blood-central nervous system interface. Neurotrophic factors, transporter molecules and enzymes involved in the metabolism of excitotoxic amino acids or in the antioxidant pathway may help protect neurons and other brain cells by controlling neurotoxin levels and contributing to homeostasis within the central nervous system. Therefore, an impairment of astroglial performance has the potential to exacerbate neuronal dysfunction. Based on the synopsis of studies presented, a number of issues become apparent that deserve a more extensive analysis. Among them are the relative contribution of microglia and astrocytes to early wound repair, the characterization of astroglial subpopulations, the specificity of the astroglial response in different diseases as well as the analysis of reactive astrocytes with techniques that can resolve fast physiologic processes. Differences between reactive astrocytes in vivo and primary astrocytes in culture are discussed and underline the need for the development and exploitation of models that will allow the analysis of reactive astrocytes in the intact organism.",1993-05-31,"Eddleston, M.; Mucke, L.",Neuroscience,,,True,custom_license

Briefly summarized, they are: 1. An infection, probably of viral type, may attack the oligodendroglia of the central nervous system; or, 2. An autoimmune process may begin with an infection of the peripheral lymphatic immune system, producing antibodies that cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to myelinoclasia. Since 1935, research has been directed toward myelin of the central nervous system and the myelin sheaths of peripheral nerve; however, dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG) have apparently not been studied. The present hypothesis states that an infectious agent (probably viral) finds privileged sanctuary in the dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG): thereafter periodically invading the spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerve. Previously reported erratic spinal fluid viral titers and cultures can be explained by differences in the anatomy of the DRG in which there is a variable and limited contact of spinal fluid with sensory ganglia. Clues to this hypothesis were noted by the author during routine neurological examinations of patients with MS, in which sensory signs and symptoms were frequently encountered. This clinical observation has also been reported by others who found such symptoms in 75% of MS patients, ranking second only to incoordination.",1993-05-31,"Nelson, D.A.",Medical Hypotheses,,,True,custom_license

Weaning occurred when daily starter intake over 7 consecutive days averaged 0.5 kg. Maximum starter intake was restricted to 3 kg day−1, and grass hay was fed ad libitum. The experiment lasted 20 weeks. Group 1 (control) received the basic diet. Groups 2 and 3 were supplemented with either 2 g purified immunoglobulins (Ig) or 25-ml pooled colostrum (CO) twice daily, via the milk replacer as used in Group 1. Neither Ig nor CO exerted a positive effect on growth rate and feed efficiency. Six calves died: two, one and three in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Their serum IG content was significantly lower than that of the surviving animals. Mechanisms explaining the lack of any protective effect are discussed. It is supposed that the main reason was due to the gap between the CO feeding at birth and the onset of the administration of Ig or CO at the start of the experiment.

The reasons for the inclusion of antibiotics in feed are outlined and discussed. In the first case, feedstuffs may have to be medicated for reasons of disease prevention and control. In large herds, especially in loose housing, mass medication by injection is not possible and even minimal disease herds will become infected with airborne pathogens from time to time. In the second case, continuous low-level feeding of antibiotics to growing pigs (growth promoters) suppresses the growth of harmful bacteria and allows healthier pigs to grow faster and more efficiently, thus producing cheaper food at the same time as improving welfare. The legal requirements regarding medicines available only on prescription are outlined and discussed. The fears and worries of the general public are noted and found to be overstated because of misconceptions and misunderstanding.

In vivo immuno-histochemical studies of the liver from infected mice have demonstrated that mechanisms other than direct viral injury are in operation. To examine potential mechanisms, the interaction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Kupffer cells with MHV 3 was studied. We first observed a dramatic inhibition in viral replication in LPS-treated Kupffer cells explanted from A/J resistant mice. Second, we demonstrated that MHV 3 induced a dose-dependent interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity in the supernatants of infected Kupffer cells of both strains. These results led us finally to examine the antigen-proceesing function of the Kupffer cellsof both strains of mice. No striking differences were observed in the ability of Kupffer cells from resistant or sensitive mice to collaborate with immunocompetent lymphocytes. Our data suggest that Kupffer cells play a double role which is crucial in the pathogenesis of MHV 3-induced hepatitis. First, they act directly as the genetically determined sensitivity of mice to MHV 3 infection is correlated with the efficiency of the antiviral activity induced in Kupffer cells by LPS. Second, they act indirectly through the synthesis of different amounts of IL-1 induced by MHV 3. This hypothesis is further borne out by the effects of indomethacin treatment on the course of MHV 3 infection in A/J resistant mice in vivo.",1988-07-31,"Keller, F.; Schmitt, C.; Kirn, A.",FEMS Microbiology Letters,,,True,custom_license

The pGE374/viral recombinant vector generates a tripartite bacterial/viral protein composed of a segment of the RecA protein at the N terminus, the coronaviral sequences in the middle, and an enzymatically active β-galactosidase at the C terminus. Rabbits immunized with such recombinant proteins generated antibodies to the MHV-A59 portion of the tripartite protein. Because the MHV-A59 polymerase proteins have been difficult to identify during infection, we used a novel method to demonstrate the viral specificity of the antiserum. The viral cDNA was excised from the expression vector, and transferred to a pGem vector, downstream from and in-frame with a portion of the cat gene. This construct contained a bacteriophage RNA polymerase promoter that enabled the cell-free synthesis of a fusion protein that was used to verify that antibodies were generated to the expressed viral DNA.

Translation efficiency in this expression system was enhanced significantly by employing the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 5'-untranslated region (UTR) which confers cap-independent translation by directing internal initiation of translation. The enhancement was accomplished by fusing open reading frames (ORFs) to the N terminus of the EMCV polyprotein coding region, thus utilizing its highly efficient translation initiation site. Expression vectors were constructed to allow cloning in all three reading frames. As reporter genes, we used the lacZ gene and a number of genes encoding coronavirus structural proteins: among others the genes encoding glycoproteins with N-terminal signal sequences. The signal sequences of these glycoproteins are located internally in the primary translation product.

In this report, we describe a method for the fine mapping of a linear sequence of the E protein of dengue virus type-2 (DEN-2), recognized by a type-specific and neutralizing monoclonal Ab (mAb), 3H5. First, an Escherichia coli expression vector containing a heat-inducible λ p l promoter was used to synthesize several truncated, and near-full length E polypeptides. Reactivities of these polypeptides with polyclonal mouse hyperimmune sera, as well as the 3H5 mAb revealed the location of the 3H5-binding site to be within a region of 166 amino acids (aa) between aa 255 and 422. For fine mapping, a series of targeted deletions were made inframe within this region using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The hydrophilicity pattern of this region was used as a guide to systematically delete the regions encoding the various groups of surface aa residues within the context of a near-full-length E polypeptide by using PCR. The 3H5-binding site was thus precisely mapped to a region encoding 12 aa (between aa 386 and 397). A synthetic peptide containing this sequence was able to bind to the 3H5 mAb specifically, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we show that rabbit Abs raised against the synthetic peptide of 12 aa were able to bind to the authentic E protein, and to neutralize DEN-2 virus in a plaque reduction assay.",1992-07-15,"Trirawatanapong, Thaweesak; Chandran, Bala; Putnak, Robert; Padmanabhan, R.",Gene,,,True,custom_license

We have now cloned several mouse Bgp cDNAs from an outbred CDR-1 mouse colon cDNA library, as well as by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of colon RNA. The distinguishing features of the deduced Bgp protein isoforms are found in the two divergent N-terminal domains, the highly conserved internal C2-set immunoglobulin domains, and an intracytoplasmic domain of either 10 or 73 amino acids (aa). The cDNA structures suggest that these mRNAs are produced through alternative splicing of a Bgp gene and the usage of multiple transcriptional terminators. The Bgp deduced aa sequences are highly homologous to several well characterized rat hepatocyte proteins such as the cell CAM105/ecto-ATPase/ppl20/HA4 proteins. Oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes representing the various cDNA isoform domains revealed predominant transcripts of 1.8, 3.1 and 4.0 kb on Northern analyses of mouse colon RNA; some of these bands are actually composed of several co-migrating transcripts. The transcripts encoding the long intracytoplasmic-tailed Bgp proteins are expressed at one-tenth the relative abundance of the shorter-tailed species. We have previously demonstrated that several mouse Bgp cDNAs, when transfected into eukaryotic cells, express BGP proteins at the cell surface and function in vitro as cell adhesion molecules, much like their human and rat counterparts.

The KmR gene was then excised by PstI, which left a 48-bp linker representing the heterologous sequence. The same procedure was followed to introduce a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) corresponding to epitope C from the spike protein S from the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). Nine insertion/deletion mutants (indels) that contained long foreign peptides variously located around the ClpG signal peptide (SP) processing site were characterized. A striking feature of this study is the variety of amino acid (aa) insertions in the ClpG prepilin that have little or no effect on CS31A fimbria biogenesis. These ‘permissive’ sites tolerate inserts of 18 or 19 aa and accept sequences of different natures in view of their aa composition, charge and hydrophobicity. The results obtained here are also interesting in light of the high level of aa sequence conservation seen in the SP and N-terminal domains of the ClpG-related subunits. The structure-function relationship of the ClpG SP is discussed. The TGEV-C epitope fused to the N-terminal end of the mature ClpG protein was cell-surface exposed, as observed on immuno-electron microscopy.

Neutralizing antibody titres were higher for the immunizing than the heterologous virus, although cross-neutralization usually was detected. This confirmed that CCV and TGEV are distinct, but antigenically related coronaviruses. In sera from 41 dogs, CCV-neutralizing titres were on average 2.7 fold higher than TGEV-neutralizing titres, suggesting that CCV was the causal agent. Sera from 29 cats in colonies with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and known to contain TGEV-neutralizing antibody, were found to have titres 12.3 fold higher against CCV. The FIP virus (FIPV) is probably more closely related to CCV than TGEV as judged by antigens involved in virus neutralization. Antisera to two isolates of bovine coronavirus, three isolates of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, seven strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus and the 229E strain of human coronavirus all failed to neutralize CCV and TGEV.

The coronvirus-like agent caused a local infection of the intestinal tract which resulted in villous atrophy, malabsorption and diarrhea. The pathogenesis of this infection was similar to that of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), a known coronaviral infection of pigs. However, where were some differences. By immunofluorescent staining, CV 777 antigens were not only detected in the epithelial cells covering the small intestinal villi, but also in the cells of the colonic surface epithelium. Occasional fluorescence was also seen in the small intestinal crypt epithelium, but the regenerative capacity of the crypts was not affected. The progress of intestinal epithelial cell infection by CV 777 was much slower than that in TGE, resulting in a longer incubation period and in less drastic epithelial cell destruction.

Antigenic studies showed the virus to be antigenically different from bovine coronavirus, parainfluenza 3 virus, bovine rotavirus, bovine parvovirus and bovine pestivirus (BVD). Attempts to culture the virus in cell or organ cultures or in embryonated eggs, were unsuccessful. The virus was either spherical or kidney shaped, with 7–9 nm peplomers on the surface. A few particles possessed coronavirus processes of 17–20 nm, but these were arranged irregularly and were thought to be tissue debris. Three out of eight experimental calves developed severe diarrhea and the lesions in the small and large intestines were similar to those reported for coronavirus. The virus replicated in the jejunal and ileal regions of the small intestine and in the spiral colon, as judged by immunofluorescence. The virus multiplied in all experimental calves and was excreted in the feces; excretion correlating with the onset of diarrhea or a change in the appearance of the feces. There was little or no malabsorption measured by the uptake of D-xylose and the fact that infection of both the crypt and villus epithelial cells was observed, suggests that the pathogenesis may be different from rotavirus and coronavirus.

Storage at temperatures lower than −20°C preserved the infectivity, while at 4°C appreciable loss occurred between 92 and 185 days. Freeze-drying or desiccation at 22°C caused only insignificant loss of infectivity. Virus preparations were not affected by pH values between 2.5 and 10.3. Inactivation by UV occurred more rapidly than with herpes, toga and rhabdoviruses. Berne virus infectivity was sensitive to pronase and B. subtilis proteinase. It was not inactivated by trypsin and chymotrypsin treatment, which resulted in enhancement of infectivity; low concentrations of pronase (< 10 μg ml−1) had a similar effect on Berne virus. Neither phospholipase C or RNase, alone or in combination, nor sodium deoxycholate (0.1%) inactivated the virus; in contrast, Triton X-100 (0.1%, 1.0%) caused rapid inactivation with a constant level of residual infectivity.",1986-02-28,"Weiss, M.; Horzinek, M.C.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

Higher levels of both specific 51Cr release and IFN were obtained in the assays containing PK-15-TGE cells. Co-cultivation of PBL from newborn piglets with PK-15-TGE cells yielded similar levels of IFN to those produced by co-cultivation of adult PBL and PK-15-TGE cells, but lower levels of IFN were produced by co-cultivation with uninfected PK-15 cells. Pretreatment of adult PBL with IFN augmented their SCMC effector activity for both PK-15 and PK-15-TGE cells in the 51Cr release assay. Pretreatment of the PK-15-TGE target cells with IFN did not affect their release of 51Cr in the SCMC reaction, while IFN pretreatment of PK-15 targets protected them against SCMC. In a single cell cytotoxicity assay the effects of IFN pretreatment on the effector adult PBL and on the PK-15 and PK-15-TGE target cells were confirmed, and SCMC incompetent PBL from neonatal piglets were rendered cytotoxic by pretreatment with IFN. PBL from newborn piglets bound to either target cell with the same frequency as PBL from SCMC competent adult pigs, and IFN pretreatment of either effector or target cells had no effect on target-binding frequency.",1986-02-28,"Cepica, A.; Derbyshire, J.B.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

The bacterium was detected by Gram stain in 52.4% of 149 cecal samples and iota-like toxin in 7.4%. From 29 strains of C. spiroforme tested, 26 were toxigenic, originating from 24 of 29 rabbitries. In 13.4% of the samples, C. spiroforme was present as the only known disease agent. Gross and microscopic lesions were similar to those described in the literature. In the other samples, C. spiroforme was associated with attaching effacing Escherichia coli (29.5%), Bacillus piliformis (10.3%), rotaviruses (25.6%), coronavirus (2.6%), Eimeria spp. (44.9%) and cryptosporidia (6.4%). In 33.3% of C. spiroforme-containing samples, more than one of these agents was present. There was no significant difference between the presence of these organisms in C. spiroforme-positive and negative samples.

Two calves were killed when clinical signs were most severe and bacteria were seen attached to the surfaces of enterocytes in the large intestine; microscopic lesions were seen in these areas. The lesions were identical to those previously reported in a natural outbreak of dysentery in calves, from which E. coli S102-9 was isolated, and to those seen in gnotobiotic calves experimentally infected with S102-9. Reinfection of the three surviving calves 16–20 days later with S102-9 and primary infection of two calves aged 24 and 51 days did not cause dysentery. Four of 659 coliforms isolated from field outbreaks of calf diarrhoea resembled the atypical strain S102-9. These four isolates and S102-9 did not produce heat-stable enterotoxin, but all produced a toxin cytopathic for Vero and HeLa cells.

Virus attachment was partially thermodependent and the rate varied, depending on the strain. Identical TGEV inocula produced a higher plaque number by plaque assay in the swine testis cell line (ST) than in the pig kidney cell line (RPD) but [3H]uridine-labèlled virus was found associated equally well with both cell lines. A field TGEV strain (Gep-II), which was unable to multiply in cell cultures, appeared able to inhibit the attachment of radiolabelled cell-passaged virus. Therefore, the susceptibility to TGEV infection was apparently not determined at the virus-to-cell attachment stage. The attachment sites on the cell surface were specific, however, differences in TGEV attachment determinant between strains were not observed.

The effect was associated with large numbers of M. bovis, identified by immunoperoxidase labelling and electromicroscopy, infiltrating between the epithelial cells and amassing in the lamina propria, especially in the region of the basement membrane of the epithelium. Ciliary activity was undiminished for up to 18 days following inoculation and little or no cytopathic effect on the ciliated epithelium was seen in spite of the close proximity of large numbers of organisms. In contrast, M. dispar was restricted to the margin of the ciliated epithelium where, as previously reported, it caused pyknosis, sloughing and flattening of the epithelium with consequent loss of ciliary activity. The cytopathology observed for each mycoplasma bore a close similarity to the behaviour of the two mycoplasmas in vivo and it is suggested that the organ culture system may be a useful and relevant system to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms for each mycoplasma.",1987-02-28,"Thomas, L.H.; Howard, C.J.; Parsons, K.R.; Anger, H.S.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

Atypical rotaviruses were not detected in any of the samples examined. Most rotavirus positive specimens were subgrouped using specific monoclonal antibodies in an ELISA test. The majority of the samples (26 out of 38) were found to exhibit Subgroup I antigenicity. Only two specimens, collected from the same herd in two consecutive months, were found to belong to Subgroup II. To characterize further the circulating rotaviruses, electrophoretic analysis of the RNA genome was performed on samples selected from nine different herds.

Additionally, polyclonal antibodies were made in rabbits and guinea pigs and extracted from the yolk of immunized hens. The antibodies were characterized by neutralization test, hemagglutination inhibition test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting. Neutralizing antibody titers of polyclonal antisera ranged from 1:1280 to 1:40 000. Only one out of 908 hybridoma colonies tested secreted antibodies with neutralizing activity. By ELISA, polyclonal sera exhibited high background reactions that could be significantly reduced by treatment with kaolin in the case of rabbit sera. Attempts to establish an ELISA for BEC antigen detection based on polyclonal sera failed due to low sensitivity and specificity. Optimal results were achieved when a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies was coated onto microplates for antigen capture, while rabbit hyperimmune serum served as detecting antibodies in an indirect assay. The combination of the two monoclonal antibodies did not increase sensitivity synergistically, but in a compensatory fashion, probably because of epitope differences between BEC field strains.",1989-06-30,"Czerny, C.-P.; Eichhorn, W.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

Growth kinetics showed peak titers of 105.5 plaque-forming units ml−1 15 h after infection. Filtration experiments and electron microscopy revealed a particle diameter between 100 and 200 nm. The bouyant density of the virus was 1.18. The particle lost its infectivity on treatment with lipid solvents. Virus replication could not be inhibited by 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine. PEDV was moderately stable at 50°C, but heat sensitivity was not altered by divalent cations. At 4°C, the virus was stable between pH 5.0 and 9.0, but at 37°C stability was restricted to the pH range 6.5–7.5. Viral infectivity was not impaired by ultrasonication or by multiple freezing and thawing. PEDV was not neutralized by transmissible gastroenteritis virus antiserum. On the basis of the tests carried out, PEDV is a pleomorphic, enveloped RNA virus with a particle diameter of ∼ 150 nm and a bouyant density of 1.18. Infectivity depends on the presence of trypsin, and infected cells show a tendency to fuse and to form syncytia. All of these properties, as well as its physicochemical characteristics, allow PEDV to be classified as a coronavirus.",1989-06-30,"Hofmann, Martin; Wyler, Robert",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

The 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) of ribavirin for uninfected, rapidly dividing cells was ∼17 μg ml−1 whereas the ID50 for FIPV was 2.5 μg ml−1. The therapeutic index (TI) of ribavirin (i.e. the ratio of the minimum cell-toxic dose to minimum virus-inhibitory dose) was 6.8. Although a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infectivity occurred at non-toxic doses, maximum antiviral effects (⩾4 log10 reduction in FIPV) occurred at cytotoxic doses. When low or moderate doses of ribavirin were combined with either 10 or 100 U of rHuIFN-α ml−1, the resulting antiviral effects were significantly greater than the sum of the observed effects from either ribavirin or rHuIFN-α alone. Significant synergistic interactions with rHuIFN-α occurred at ribavirin doses of 1, 5, 12.5 and 25 μg ml−1. Synergistic combinations of rHuIFN-α and ribavirin produced up to an 80-fold or a 200-fold relative increase in FIPV antiviral activities compared with that produced by equivalent doses, respectively, or ribavirin or rHuIFN-α alone. In cell growth studies, the addition of either 10 or 100 U of rHuIFN-α ml−1 to test doses of ribavirin did not increase the anticellular effect observed with ribavirin alone; seemingly, the potentiation of ribavirin antiviral activity by rHuIFN-α was independent of any additive cytotoxic effects. Potentially, synergistic combinations of the two antiviral agents in vivo may decrease the therapeutic dose of ribavirin required for inhibition of FIPV and thus reduce drug toxicity.",1989-07-31,"Weiss, Richard C.; Oostrom-Ram, Theresia",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

Feces or nasal swab fluids were incubated sequentially with hyperimmune bovine anti-bovine coronavirus serum and protein A-gold, negatively stained, applied to formvar-coated copper grids and viewed using an electron microscope. The PAG-IEM method specifically identified BCV particles and possible subviral particles in feces and nasal-swab fluids from infected calves. The PAG-IEM method did not label other enveloped enteric viruses or morphologically similar fringed particles commonly found in feces. Detection of BCV using PAG-IEM was compared with ELISA and direct immunofluorescence (IF) of nasal epithelial cells by monitoring fecal and respiratory tract shedding of BCV from two experimentally infected and two naturally infected calves from birth to 3 weeks of age. PAG-IEM and ELISA detected shedding of BCV in fecal ( 4 4 animals) and nasal ( 3 4 animals) samples for an average of 5.25 days each. The observed agreement of BCV detection by PAG-IEM and ELISA was 85%. PAG-IEM may be a more sensitive immunoassay for the detection of BCV in diagnostic specimens from infected neonatal calves than ELISA. BCV infection of nasal epithelial cells was detected by immunofluorescence in 4 4 calves, persisted for the duration of the study in 2 4 calves and was sporadic in the other two animals.

Infectious virus was released from the cells within 7 days post-infection in early passages and within 3 days in later passages. In the absence of trypsin, neither passage infected cells nor release of infectious virus occurred. The virus was shown to be similar to the fecal astrovirus by a neutralization test and by ultrastructural studies of infected cells. Primary embryo bovine kidney (EBK) and NBK cell cultures supported infection with both fecal and tissue culture adapted (TCA) astrovirus. The time-related development of infection, as studied by immunofluorescence, was similar for both fecal and TCA astrovirus and for both cell culture types. The first indication of viral infection and expression of viral antigens occurred at 7 h post-infection and was characterized by the appearance of a diffuse faint immunofluorescence (IF) of the cytoplasm. Soon after, two or three brilliant IF granules were observed in the nucleus, which appeared to involve the nucleoli. Subsequently, dense granular IF was seen in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm, which later extended to involve all the cytoplasmic area. In both EBK and NBK cultures infected with either fecal or tissue culture adapted astrovirus, only a minority of cells became infected, even when the multiplicity of infections exceeded one. Occasionally 10–20% of cells were infected, but in most cultures the proportion did not exceed 2% and in NBK cultures, from 3 9 calves, no infected cells were observed. The virus did not infect bovine cell lines. Infectivity of the virus was not removed by treatment with chloroform, and iododeoxyuridine and actinomycin D when added to the medium, did not block replication. Masses of virions were observed by electron microscopy in discrete areas in the cytoplasm, with similar distributions as the viral antigen foci as seen by IF. The mean diameter of the virions was 34 nm. In conclusion, bovine astrovirus lacks both essential lipids and an envelope, probably has an RNA genome, may have a nuclear phase of replication involving the nucleoli which is not blocked by DNA inhibitors, and has a selective cell tropism.",1989-02-28,"Aroonprasert, Daranai; Fagerland, Jane A.; Kelso, Nancy E.; Zheng, Shilun; Woode, Gerald N.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

The periods of respiratory shedding of BCV were determined by direct immunofluorescent (DIF) staining of nasal epithelial cells and ELISA of nasal swab supernatant fluids. The periods of fecal shedding of BCV were determined by ELISA and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). The isotype-specific antibody titers to BCV in serum (at selected intervals between 0 and 120 days of age) and the post-suckling (24 to 48 h after birth) total immunoglobulin levels were examined by ELISA and zinc sulfate turbidity tests, respectively. Of the 8 calves studied, 4 had evidence of BCV respiratory (by DIF or ELISA) or enteric infections (by IEM or ELISA) in association with diarrhea or rhinitis, even though 7 or 8 calves showed increases in one or more serum antibody isotypes to BCV and 6 of 8 calves showed BCV respiratory or enteric antigen shedding by ELISA. Serological antibody titer increases occurred in 3 calves before 30 days of age and in 4 calves after 30 days of age; two of the latter calves had a second rise in serum antibody titers to BCV after the initial rise. A serological antibody titer increase was not observed in one calf. This suggests that BCV infections may be very common in a closed herd and may occur in older calves, although many may be subclinical and some may be recurrent. There were no statistically significant correlations between total serum immunoglobulin levels or BCV antibody isotype titers in serum (24–48 h after birth) and clinical disease or infection by BCV; however, calves with low levels of IgA BCV antibodies in serum (24–48 h after birth) had a significantly greater average number of days with diarrhea than those calves having high levels of IgA BCV-specific antibodies in serum.",1990-04-30,"Heckert, R.A.; Saif, L.J.; Hoblet, K.H.; Agnes, A.G.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

Important progress has recently been made concerning the molecular biology of TGEV. The research work of our group has been focused on two main aspects: genome structure and functional domains of the envelope proteins. TGEV genomic RNA is organised into seven regions. The sequence of six of them, i.e. the 3′ most 8300 nucleotides, has been established from cDNA clones. Three genes encoding the structural proteins, the peplomer protein E2, the transmembrane protein E1 and the nucleoprotein, have been identified. Additional open reading frames allowed for the prediction of four non-structural polypeptides, the role of which remains to be discovered. The remaining part of the genome (estimated length 20 kb) is thought to encode the polymerase. Expression of TGEV genes involves the production of six subgenomic mRNAs, which together with the virion RNA, form a 3′ terminal nested set. The peplomer glycoprotein E2 (220 kDa) is 1431 residues long and highly glycosylated. Several domains were identified, including a C-terminal anchoring region and at least four major antigenic sites, which cluster in the amino half part of the molecule. Two sites containing most of the critical neutralisation determinants are highly conserved among TGEV strains. The glycoprotein E1 (29kDa) is mostly embedded in the membrane and plays a crucial role in the virion architecture. However, a short N-terminal domain protruding out of the particle mediates complement-dependent neutralisation, and induces alpha interferon synthesis, likely through a direct interaction with the lymphocyte membrane.",1990-06-30,"Laude, Hubert; Rasschaert, Denis; Delmas, Bernard; Godet, Murielle; Gelfi, Jacqueline; Charley, Bernard",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

By probing porcine genomic libraries with human and porcine IFN-α probes to isolate related genes, we have shown that the porcine IFN-α multigene family included, like several other mammalian species, two subfamilies of related but distinct genes. Class I subfamily contains at least 11 loci, located on chromosome no. 1, among which nine have been cloned and two (potentially functional) sequenced. Class II subfamily, which is specifically expressed by the embryo of ruminants before implantation, contains at least seven loci among which six have been cloned. One of the sequenced class I loci: PoIFN-α1 encodes a 189 amino acids (AA) preprotein. After removal of the sequence encoding the putative signal peptide (23 N-terminal AA) this gene was inserted into an Escherichia coli bicistronic expression vector allowing intracellular synthesis of mature porcine IFN-α1 (methionyl IFN-α1). Expression of the recombinant protein was optimized by insertion of a seven base pairs long random synthetic sequence in the intercistronic region, followed by cloning in E. coli and immunodetection of clones expressing high amounts of recombinant protein. The E. coli strain obtained produced high levels of a 18 000 Da protein exhibiting the same in vitro overall biological properties as leucocyte derived porcine IFN (LeuIFN). However, it had a stronger antiviral effect on porcine cells than LeuIFN. After immunoaffinity purification to a specific activity of 5−10 × 107 International Units (IU)/mg of protein, pharmacokinetic and pharmacological studies were realized to determine the in vivo half life of this rIFN-α in the pig.

Recombinant complementary DNA (cDNA) representing gene 9 (the gene encoding the neutralization antigens in VP7 glycoprotein) from OSU (porcine rotavirus serotype 1) and Gottfried (porcine rotavirus serotype 2) strains were used to determine the optimal hybridization conditions which allow specific detection of group A porcine rotaviruses. Probes were prepared by excision of the inserts from the recombinant plasmids and radiolabeling of cDNA with 32P by the random primer extension method. Probes were hybridized at various stringencies with viral RNA from different rotavirus serotypes bound to nylon membranes. Hybridization at low stringency (26% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) had high sensitivity but low specificity. Hybridization at high stringency (16% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) produced high specificity but decreased the sensitivity observed at low stringency. Probes were specific for rotavirus at both stringencies and did not hybridize with nucleic acids from other porcine viruses. Subgenomic gene 9 fragments were then tested to provide more specific probes. A 322 bp fragment from OSU gene 9 between nucleotides 382 and 704 and a 266 bp fragment from Gottfried gene 9 between nucleotides 230 and 496 were found to be specific as hybridization probes. These studies demonstrated the feasibility of the dot blot hybridization assay using subgenomic fragments of gene 9 to detect and differentiate serotypes of porcine rotavirus. Additional studies are warranted to further evaluate the sensitivity and the capability of these probes to detect porcine field isolates of the same serotype.,1990-09-30,"Johnson, Michael E.; Paul, Prem S.; Gorziglia, Mario; Rosenbusch, Ricardo",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

The pregnant sows were immunized once (42–49 days before farrowing) or twice (42–49 and 7–15 days before farrowing) by the oral, intramuscular or conjunctival route with the 188-SG strain. Sows exposed to virulent TGEV in the field and experimentally infected sows (two oral inoculations during pregnancy) were used as positive controls leading to high protection. The neutralizing antibody response to vaccination and/or infection was studied in serum and milk. No protection against mortality was observed in the litters of (1) the nine seronegative, susceptible sows, with piglet mortality of 65/70, (2) the seven once orally vaccinated sows, with mortality of 44/54, (3) the seven sows vaccinated twice by the conjunctival route, with mortality of 55/76. Moderate protection was observed in (1) the eight sows vaccinated intramuscularly twice with piglet mortality of 36/90, (2) the seven orally and intramuscularly vaccinated sows with piglet mortality of 31/51. In contrast, improved protection was observed in (1) the 10 sows vaccinated twice orally, with piglet mortality of 23/95, (2) the four naturally infected sows with piglet mortality of 6/41, (3) the six sows experimentally infected with virulent TGEV with piglet mortality of 1/59. No correlation was found between neutralizing antibodies titers in serum and milk and protection rate of the piglets.

Although the mechanism(s) whereby FIPV causes disease are still incompletely understood, there have been significant contributions to the literature over the past decade which provide a framework upon which plausible explanations can be postulated. Two concepts are presented which attempt to clarify the pathogenesis of FIPV and at the same time may serve as an impetus for further research. The first involves the hypothesis, originally promulgated by Pedersen in 19891, that FIPV is derived from FECV during virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract. The second involves a unique mechanism of the mucosal immune system referred to as oral tolerance, which under normal conditions promotes the production of secretory immunity and suppresses the production of systematic immunity. In the case of FIPV infection, we propose that oral tolerance is important in the control of the virus at the gastrointestinal tract level. Once oral tolerance is disrupted, FIPV is capable of systemic spread resulting in immune-mediated vasculitis and death. Thus, it may be that clinical forms of FIP are due to a combination of two events, the first being the generation of FIPV from FECV, and the second being the capacity of FIPV to circumvent oral tolerance.",1991-08-31,"Evermann, James F.; McKeirnan, Alison J.; Ott, Richard L.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

Sixteen MAbs which reacted with all of the 11 strains of feline coronaviruses, also reacted with canine coronavirus (CCV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In many of them, the polypeptide specifity was the recognition of transmembrane (E1) protein of the virus. We succeeded in obtaining MAbs which did not react with eight strains FIPV Type I viruses (showing cell-associated growth) but reacted with FIPV Type II (79-1146, KU-1) and/or FECV Type II (79-1683) viruses (showing non-cell associated growth). These MAbs also reacted with CCV or TGEV. These MAbs recognized peplomer (E2) glycoprotein, and many antigenic differences were found in this E2 protein. These results suggest that FIPV Type II and FECV Type II viruses are antigenically closer to TGEV or CCV than to FIPV Type I viruses.

The donor piglets developed clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis which persisted for up to 3 days, and they developed peak serum titres of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies 2 weeks post-infection. The leukocytes were cultured in the presence of pokeweed mitogen (PWM), various dilutions of purified TGEV, or control media for 3 or 5 days, and the culture supernatants were tested for antiviral activity in MDBK cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus. The antiviral activity was characterized as porcine interferon (IFN)-α or porcine IFN-τ on the basis of its stability at pH 2.0 and neutralization by anti-human IFN-α antibodies. Viability of the leukocytes in culture, determined by trypan blue exclusion, was highest for the peripheral blood leukocytes and lowest for the mesenteric lymph node leukocytes. There were no consistent differences in antiviral activity between cultures incubated for 3 or 5 days. Porcine IFN-α was found in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with TGEV antigen, harvested before or after infection of the donor piglets with TGEV.

Four antigenic sites have been defined (A, B, C, and D). The sites involved in the neutralization of TGEV are: A, D, and B, sites A and D being antigenically dominant for TGEV neutralization in vitro. These two sites have specific properties of interest: site A is highly conserved and is present in coronaviruses of three animal species, and site D can be represented by synthetic peptides. Both sites might be relevant in protection in vivo. PRCV does not have sites B and C, due to a genomic deletion. Complex antigenic sites, i.e., conformation and glycosylation dependent sites, have been represented by simple mimotopes selected from a library expressing recombinant peptides with random sequences, or by anti-idiotypic internal image monoclonal antibodies. An epidemiological tree relating the TGEVs and PRCVs has been proposed. The estimated mutation fixation rate of 7 ± 2 × 10−4 substitutions per nucleotide and year indicates that TGEV related coronaviruses show similar variability to other RNA viruses. In order to induce secretory immunity, different segments of the S gene have been expressed using avirulent forms of Salmonella typhimurium and adenovirus.

However, it is antigenically and genetically distinct from HIV; an antigenic relatedness with equine infectious anaemia virus has been demonstrated. FIV has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Diagnostic tests are commercially available and attempts at preparing inactivated, subunit and molecularly engineered vaccines are being made in different laboratories. During FIV infection a transient primary illness can be recognized, with fever, neutropenia and lymphadenopathy. After a long period of clinical normalcy a secondary stage is distinguished with signs of an immunodeficiency-like syndrome. The incubation period for this stage can be as long as 5 years, during which gradual impairment of immune function develops. Many FIV-infected cats are presented for the first time showing vague signs of illness: recurrent fevers, emaciation, lack of appetite, lymphadenopathy, anaemia, leucopenia and behavioural changes. Later, the predominant clinical signs observed are chronic stomatitis/gingivitis, enteritis, upper respiratory tract infections, and infections of the skin. Neoplasias, neurological, immunological and haematological disorder are seen in a smaller proportion. The immunodeficiency-like syndrome is progressive over a period of months to years. Concomitant infection with feline leukaemia virus has been shown to accelarate the progression of disease. In vitro, phenotypic mixing between FIV and an endogenous feline oncovirus (RD114) has been demonstrated which leads to a broadening of the cell spectrum of the lentivirus. Bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) has been isolated only once, and all attempts to obtain additional isolates have failed; it has been recovered from the leucocytes of cattle with persistent lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, lesions in the central nervous system, progressive weakness and emaciation. As with the feline representative, BIV also was found to possess a lentivirus morphology and to encode a reverse transcriptase with Mg++ preference; it replicates and induces syncytia in a variety of embryonic bovine tissues in vitro. Antigenic analyses have demonstrated a conservation of epitopes between the major core protein of BIV and HIV. The original isolate has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Besides the three large open reading frames (ORFs) comprising the gag, pol, and env genes common to all replication-competent retroviruses, five additional small ORFs were found. Numerous point mutations and deletions were found, mostly in the env-encoding ORF. These data suggest that, within a single virus isolate, BIV displays extensive genomic variation. When random cattle sera from the Netherlands were tested by indirect immunofluorescence, Western blot and/or radio-immunoprecipitation, 0.7% appeared seropositive; thus BIV infection is not uncommon in one European cattle population.",1992-11-30,"Egberink, H.; Horzinek, M.C.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

The P-10, P-15 and P-24 regions of the gag gene of FIV were chosen as the target sequences for amplification, and three primer pairs were prepared. The PCR products subjected to amplification with each primer pair were found to possess sites of digestion by a restriction enzyme, as hypothesized. They did not react with feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected or feline syncytium-forming virus (FeSFV)-infected cell-derived DNA, and specifically amplified FIV-infected cell-derived DNA. FIV proviral DNA was detected by the PCR method with either primer pair (one-step amplification: single PCR) in DNA derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 7 of 12 FIV antibody-positive cats. When PCR products in each of the 12 cats were subjected to a second amplification using the same primer pair (two-step amplification: double PCR), FIV proviral DNA was detected in all of the cats. When PBL samples collected from three cats that were negative and three that were positive in the single PCR were cultured for a few weeks in the presence of interleukin 2, FIV proviral DNA was detected in all six cats by the single PCR method. The results suggest that either the use of cultured PBL as the sample or the performance of the double PCR method enables simple and specific detection of FIV proviral DNA in PBL.",1992-02-29,"Hohdatsu, T.; Yamada, M.; Okada, M.; Fukasawa, M.; Watanabe, K.; Ogasawara, T.; Takagi, M.; Aizawa, C.; Hayami, M.; Koyama, H.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

Rotavirus was detected in 78% ( 106 136 ) and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in 1.5% of the samples ( 2 136 ) obtained from sick calves. In comparison rotavirus was identified in only 1.6% ( 1 63 ) of the samples from clinically healthy calves. The rotavirus strain responsible for the outbreak was characterized as serotype 6 belonging to group A. In the following three years the protective capacity of a combined rotavirus—E. coli inactivated vaccines administered to the dams during the last third of the gestation period was evaluated on this farm by comparison of morbidity due to diarrhea in calves from vaccinated vs. placebo cows within the same year. The morbidity due to diarrhea among calves from dams in the vaccinated and placebo groups was 34% and 77%, respectively in 1986; 23% and 47% in 1987, and 15% and 34%, in 1988. In 1987 morbidity of diarrhea in calves born from vaccinated heifers was 54% and 74% in calves from placebo heifers. In 1988 morbidity from diarrhea was 41% and 54%, respectively among calves in these two groups. In all experiments, calves from heifers showed significantly greater morbidity than calves from cows. Differences in diarrhea morbidity between the vaccinated and placebo groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). Additional studies showed that the diarrhea had a significant influence (P<0.05) on the average live weight of the calves at weaning (5 to 7 months) with an average weight loss of 7.8 kg per calf among the calves affected with diarrhea.",1992-02-29,"Cornaglia, E.M.; Fernández, F.M.; Gottschalk, M.; Barrandeguy, M.E.; Luchelli, A.; Pasini, M.I.; Saif, L.J.; Parraud, J.R.; Romat, A.; Schudel, A.A.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

This is the first serological evidence of a specific coronavirus infection in mink. The putative mink coronavirus (MCV) seems to be widespread in the Danish mink population with a prevalence approaching 100%. Analysis by immunoblotting has shown that MCV is closely related to TGEV by the spike (S), matrix (M) and nucleoprotein (N) polypeptides. Furthermore, antibodies to MCV also cross-reacted with N and M polypeptides of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Thus MCV may occupy an intermediate position between the TGEV group of coronaviruses and PEDV. The possibility that MCV may be associated with syndromes of acute enteritis in preweaning mink is discussed.",1992-04-30,"Have, P.; Moving, V.; Svansson, V.; Uttenthal, Å.; Bloch, B.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

The primary phase of infection was characterised by a range of haematological (neutropenia, lymphopenia, presence of atrypical lymphocytes) and clinical alterations (fever, various signs lasting several weeks, generalised lymphadenopathy persisting for several months) and specific seroconversion. A correlation between the inoculated dose of virus and the intensity and duration of clinical signs was observed.

The probe cross-hybridized in the dot blot assay with nucleic acid of a closely related feline coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)-79-1683. To construct the probe, a 2.5 kilobase cDNA, prepared from FIPV-DF2 genomic RNA, was molecularly cloned. The recombinant cDNA clone was digested with the restriction endonuclease Rsa I, and an 870 basepair Rsa I fragment was isolated from vector DNA by agarose electrophoresis and glassmilk purification. This fragment was complementary to the 3′ three fourths of the nucleocapsid gene. The hybridization probe was prepared by random primed labeling in the presence of biotin-11-dUTP. Using an avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and chemiluminescent substrate detection system, virus could be detected in as few as 3000 infected cells. In an in vivo study, the probe was used to detect FIPV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) isolated at various post-infection days (PID) from cats experimentally infected with the FIP-producing coronavirus isolate FIPV-79-1146 or FIPV-DF2. Viral RNA could be detected in as few as 12 000 PBML isolated from cats at PID 7 and in 50 000 PBML at PID 22. There was no consistent pattern, however, between hybridization results and prognosis or severity of disease at the time of sampling.

They belong to at least five antigenic groups. CV cause localized infections of the respiratory and/or intestinal tracts, with the exception of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIVP) and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis (HEV) which cause systemic infections. The enteropathogenic CV infect the villous enterocytes resulting in villous atrophy leading to malabsorptive diarrhea. Several CV (bovine CV-BCV, porcine respiratory CV-PRCV, infectious bronchitis virus-IBV) cause respiratory disease. Current evidence indicates that protection against enteric and respiratory CV infections is mediated by passive or active immunity at the primary site of CV replication. Maternal vaccination approaches to induce passive immunity include the use of inactivated and modified live viral vaccines. Modified live viruses and a Ts mutant CV (FIPV) are also used as oral or intranasal vaccines to induce active mucosal immunity. The success of these vaccines in the field is often compromised by a number of potential problems. Coronaviruses are spherical, enveloped viruses, ranging from 80–160 nm in diameter and containing a positive-stranded RNA genome. They possess prominent surface spikes and some species display a fringe of smaller surface projections believed to be the hemagglutinin (HE). Coronaviruses possess 3 to 4 structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein (150–200 kDa), the integral membrane glycoprotein (M; 20–30 kDa) and the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N; 43–50 kDa). A subset of CV (BCV, HEV, turkey CV) possess a third glycoprotein on the virion surface, the HE (60–65 kDa). These proteins can be quantitated using pooled monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to distinct epitopes of each protein in ELISA. Most research has focused on the S protein as a candidate antigen for CV vaccines since it induces virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies. However the HE protein stimulates the production of VN and HE inhibiting antibodies and the M protein induces antibodies that neutralize virus in the presence of complement. Attempts to correlate in vitro VN antibody activity with in vivo protection have shown that the passive transfer of VN mAb to the S or HE protein conferred passive protection against CV challenge in some studies, but not others. Additional research has implicated a possible role for other CV proteins in immunity. Studies of mAb to the M protein of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) have provided evidence for a direct role of the M protein in the induction of αIFN by porcine blood leukocytes. The potential significance of this phenomenon to immunity to TGEV is unclear. Similarly, studies of IBV have suggested that determinants recognized by T cells reside on the N protein and these determinants may be shared among heterologous strains of IBV, resulting in the induction of cross-protection. Thus epitopes on the N protein may be important for induction of cell mediated immunity (CMI). CMI may play an important role in protection of cats against FIPV, since induction of circulating antibodies to the S protein of FIPV contributes to disease pathogenesis by the induction of immune complexes and antibody dependent enhancement of the infectivity of FIPV for macrophages. An increased understanding of antibody and CMI responses following natural CV infections in animals is needed to identify the antigens and epitopes that induce protective immune responses. The expression of CV structural protein genes in various vectors will provide the recombinant proteins needed for future immunogenicity studies in the host species. Furthermore, live rDNA vectors that replicate in the gut and express coronavirus genes may provide a new generation of coronavirus vaccines.",1993-11-30,"Saif, Linda J.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

Rotavirus excretion was not detected in faeces from cows around parturition by any of the three tests. However, all of their calves shed rotaviruses during the observation period. The onset of rotavirus excretion determined by PAGE ranged from day 2 to day 8 of life (day 4.8± 1.8 on average) and lasted for 4 to 7 days (5.3±1.1 days on average). Chi-square test showed a significant association (P=0.0001) between the presence of rotavirus and the altered consistency of calves faeces. All the three tests showed similar results (overall agreement 92.5%) but discrepancies were detected mainly at the beginning or at the end of the rotavirus excretion period.

Most TGEV isolates produced a typical cytopathic effect (CPE) in swine testis (ST) cell culture, which included a ballooning or lifting away of the infected cells from the cell monolayer with heavy granulation evident. Minor variations in CPE were observed with one isolate, IA-145. Protein profiles of the TGEV isolates as determined by SDS-PAGE were essentially identical, with the exception of the isolate IA-101. The TGEV isolate IA-101 presented a higher molecular mass M protein and lacked an N protein doublet that was present in all other TGEV isolates. The TGEV isolates were shown to be closely related antigenically by using hyperimmune sera in a virus neutralization (VN) test. Some antigenic diversity was detected by utilizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a VN test. Titers of the mAbs were highest with the homologous Miller TGEV, and one virus isolate, IA-156, was very poorly neutralized with the mAbs used in this study.

Whole-cell lysates from Borrelia spp., leptospiral serovars, and Serpulina spp. were used for SDS-PAGE, western blots, and KELA. Cross-reactivity occurred between the antibodies to B. burgdorferi and leptospiral serovars when tested on the heterologous antigens.

The antibodies against B. burgdorferi showed a lesser degree of cross-reactivity to the antigens of S. hyodysenteriae and S. innocens than they did to leptospiral serovars. We conclude that cross-reactivity occurs between B. burgdorferi and leptospiral serovars. Validation and interpretation of ELISA tests for detection of antibody activity to whole cell lysates of the Lyme agent must take this cross-reactivity into consideration.

Sera from gnotobiotic swine exposed to prototypic reference European and American isolates of PRRSV and sera from conventionally reared European and American swine convalescing from naturally acquired PRRSV infections were used to characterize the BP03-P protein. Sera from gnotobiotic and conventionally reared swine exposed to European isolates of PRRSV were significantly more reactive (P < 0.01) with BP03-P than were the corresponding American PRRSV antisera using the indirect immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). Prototypic European, but not American, PRRSV antisera also recognized BP03-P using western immunoblotting and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) procedures. However, gnotobiotically derived antiserum to an atypical American-origin PRRSV was reactive with BP03-P by both IPMA and western immunoblot.

Titres of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were reduced between 6 and 15 hours post-infection in ST cells treated with 1000 or 2500 units/ml of IFN. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of lysates of TGEV-infected ST cells, and of lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-TGEV antibodies, revealed that the synthesis of the N and S proteins of TGEV was reduced in cells treated with 100 or 1000 units/ml of IFN. Viral RNA production, as determined with a probe which hybridized to the S gene of TGEV, was found to be reduced in ST cells treated with 1000 units/ml of IFN, but not in cells treated with 100 units/ml. It was concluded that, in IFN-treated ST cells, TGEV protein production may be decreased in the absence of reduced viral RNA production, and that 2–5 A synthetase may not be a significant factor in the antiviral activity of IFN against TGEV.",1995-06-30,"Jordan, L.T.; Derbyshire, J.B.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

When the virulent Purdue strain of TGEV was used, villous atrophy was seen and TGEV antigen was demonstrated immunohistochemically in the villous enterocytes. The Miller M6 strain of virus produced less extensive lesions in the segments, but since it was titratable by plaque assay it was used in the subsequent yield reduction assays to determine the antiviral activity of interferon. When intestinal segments were inoculated simultaneously with either 3200 units of natural porcine interferon-α or up to 100000 units of recombinant human interferon-α2a, and TGEV, there were no reductions in virus yield, although the same cytokines exerted an antiviral effect in ST cells treated in a similar way. However, virus yields were significantly reduced in intestinal segments in piglets treated parenterally with teh synthetic interferon inducer polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid 6 hours before challenge of the segments with TGEV. There was also a trend for the antiviral effects of interferon induction before challenge to be augmented by the inclusion of interferon with the virus inoculum.

Nothern blot by hybridizations using whole genomic RNA probes indicated that strains NS-1 and NS-2 had identical group A RNA electrophoretic patterns and were homologous at all gene segments. Strain NS-1 was compared with reference group A BRV strains using serological and genotypic methods. In vitro virus neutralization assays indicated that strain NS-1 was neutralized by a G6-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) and guinea pig hyperimmune serum (GPHS) raised against BRV strain B641 (P5:G6), but not by G10-specific neutralizing mAb or GPHS raised against BRV strain BRV strain B223 (P11:G10). Nucleic acid hybridization experiments using whole-genomic RNA probes revealed that gene segment 4 of strain NS-1 differed from BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B223, but hybridized with strain B641. Conversely, gene segment 5 of strain NS-1 hybridized with BRV strain B223, but not with BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641. A G-specific cDNA probe produced by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of strain NS-1 hybridized specifically only with G6 strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641, but not with G10 strain B223. Co-electrophoresis experiments using strains NS-1, B641, and B223 further confirmed these results, suggesting that strain NS-1 was a naturally-occurring reassortant BRV between strains B641 and B223. Taken together these results indicated that a naturally-occurring group A BRV reassortant with a P gene different from the vaccine virus was responsible for the diarrheal syndrome observed on both ranches. Results from this study also indicate the existence of at least 2 different gene segments 5 among group A BRV infecting cattle.",1994-11-30,"Lu, Wei; Duhamel, Gerald E.; Benfield, David A.; Grotelueschen, Dale M.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

Demyelination occurs in infected white matter areas in the absence of inflammation. The mechanism of demyelination is not apparent because there is no ultrastructural evidence of viral replication in the oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells. However, brain tissue culture studies have shown that oligodendrocytes support transcription of all CDV genes and later on degenerate, although no viral proteins can be found in these cells. It remains to be shown how such a restricted infection leads to demyelination. Concomitant with immunologic recovery during the further course of the disease, inflammation occurs in the demyelinating lesions with progression of the lesions in some animals. A series of experiments in vitro suggested that chronic demyelination is due to a bystander mechanism associated with the virus-induced immune response in which antibody dependent cell-mediated reactions play an important role. The progressive, or even relapsing, course of the disease is associated with viral persistence in the nervous system. Persistence of CDV in the brain appears to be due to non-cytolytic selective spread of the virus with very limited budding. In this way CDV escapes immune surveillance.",1995-05-31,"Vandevelde, Marc; Zurbriggen, Andreas",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

The aim was to determine if dual infections, as compared to single virus infections, result in enhanced clinical manifestations. It was also examined if PRRSV replication affects replication of PRCV or SIV in the respiratory tract. Groups of conventional 10 week old pigs were inoculated with PRRSV-only (3 pigs), PRCV-only (4 pigs) or SIV-only (4 pigs). Dual inoculations with PRRSV-PRCV (4 pigs) and PRRSV-SIV (3 groups of 4, 4 and 5 pigs) were performed at a 3 day interval. A group of uninoculated control pigs (8 pigs) was included. The infection with PRRSV-only induced a transient fever (40.2°C) at 2 DPI, but no respiratory signs. The PRCV-only infection remained subclinical. The SIV-only infection resulted in a one day fever (40.1°C) with moderate tachypnoea and dyspnoea. Mean weight gain in the virus-inoculated groups was retarded compared with the control group. The PRRSV-PRCV infection induced a 9 day lasting fever (peak 40.9°C) with tachypnoea, dyspnoea and productive coughing. The PRRSV-SIV infection resulted in fever and respiratory signs in all 3 groups. Clinical signs, however, were more pronounced in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3. Pigs of group 1 showed fever during 10 days (peak 41.4°C), tachypnoea, marked dyspnoea with abdominal breathing, and a productive cough. Pigs of groups 2 and 3 had fever for 5 and 3 days (peaks 40.6 and 40.3°C) respectively and mild respiratory disorders. Mean weight gain during 14 DPI of the 2nd virus was 5.9 kg in the PRRSV-PRCV group and 4.0, 6.8 and 6.7 kg in PRRSV-SIV groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Mean weight gain during the corresponding period in the PRRSV-only group was 8.6 kg. It was concluded that dual infections with viruses causes more severe disease and growth retardation than single PRRSV infection. PRCV excretion curves were similar in single and dual virus inoculated groups. Excretion of SIV was delayed by 2 days in the dual inoculated pigs.

The emergence of new virus diseases,10.1016/0378-1135(95)92531-F,,7740750.0,els-covid,"Abstract The sudden appearance of apparently new viruses with pathogenic potential is of fundamental importance in medical microbiology and a constant threat to humans and animals. The emergence of a “new” pathogen is not an isolated event, as for instance the frequent appearance of new influenza virus strains demonstrates. Often the new virus strains co-circulate with the older strains in a susceptible population, but a replacement of the older strains has been also observed. In rare instances the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or most recently, with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The mechanisms of the emergence are not always clearly understood, but an altered host range appears to be a common event. Whether a true change in host range occurs, or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently, is often unknown. This review tries to summarize the facts that are known about a wide variety of “new” viruses of mammals, such as the simian, human and feline lentiviruses, the feline coronaviruses, the feline parvoviruses, the carnivore morbilliviruses, the influenza A viruses, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. A particular emphasis will be put on the genetic mechanisms that might have taken place and that might have been responsible for their sudden appearance.",1995-02-28,"Truyen, Uwe; Parrish, Colin R.; Harder, Timm C.; Kaaden, Oskar-Rüger",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

Forty seven field isolates were obtained from cats with acute oral/respiratory disease, chronic oral lesions, and from cats showing vaccine reactions, i.e. clinical signs of FCV infection shortly after vaccination. Eight reference strains including F9 and three vaccine strains based on F9 were also examined. All of the strains of F9, derived from various sources, reacted with all six of the monoclonal antibodies, whereas some of the field isolates did not react with any. In general, the field isolates showed a spectrum of reactivities and selected isolates could be distinguished. However, there were no clear cut differences between the clinical groups. Overall, the oral/respiratory group showed less reactivity with the monoclonals, suggesting they were less related to F9. Although the other groups appeared to be more closely related to F9, none of the isolates reacted with all six monoclonal antibodies.",1996-08-31,"McArdle, F.; Dawson, S.; Carter, M.J.; Milton, I.D.; Turner, P.C.; Meanger, J.; Bennett, M.; Gaskell, R.M.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

Serum-virus neutralizing antibody (SVN) test titers were measured in colostrum and pigs at the next farrowing, and additional vaccination of sows prior to the third farrowing led to elevated SVN titers in serum, colostrum and all pigs. Six pigs from vaccinated sows challenged at 8 to 9 days of age with 1 × 106 TCID50 EEEV did not develop the high temperatures or signs of central nervous system disease that 6 pigs from non-vaccinated sows developed. Virus was isolated from blood and oropharyngeal swabs from all pigs from non-vaccinated sows with blood virus titers as high as 9.3 × 104 TCID50, while only low levels of virus were detected in blood and oropharyngeal swabs from pigs from vaccinated sows. Virus was also isolated from tonsils collected at necropsy from 3 pigs from non-vaccinated and 1 pig from vaccinated sows. Vaccination of pregnant sows leads to development of maternal antibodies that are transmitted via colostrum to pigs and are protective against clinical EEEV related disease after experimental challenge with EEEV. In addition, vaccination prevents amplification of virus in infected pigs and could result in protection of animals and farm labor in the environment of infected pigs.",1996-08-31,"Elvinger, François; Baldwin, Charles A.; Liggett, Alan D.; Tang, Kai N.; Dove, C.Robert",Veterinary Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

Microbiological and serological examinations confirmed the germ-free state of the germ-free rats and showed that no specific lung pathogens were present in the conventional rats. As in conventional rats, clinical symptoms and death of OSSMe-treated germ-free rats resulted from respiratory failure. The germ-free rats were not more resistant, but rather more susceptible to OSSMe than conventional rats. Increases in lung weight and histological examination of lung tissue 3 days after dosing with OSSMe (75 mg/kg, s.c.) showed no differences between germ-free and conventional rats. Despite alterations in their nasopharyngeal flora, death in the conventional rats was probably not caused by bacterial superinfection. The higher susceptibility of germ-free rats to OSSMe can be partly attributed to pharmacokinetic differences, since plasma levels of OSSMe decreased more slowly in germ-free than in conventional rats. It is concluded that germ-free rats are not protected from the lethal consequences of acute chemical-induced lung damage.",1986-08-31,"Nemery, B.; Tucker, D.K.; Sparrow, S.",Toxicology Letters,,,True,custom_license

The outcome of 39 pregnancies after artificial insemination or natural service during a 4 month period of risk for contracting BVDV was nine abortions, one mummified foetus, one still-birth, three calves that died within 1 week of age, 12 calves persistently infected (PI) with BVDV (11 males and one female) and 13 non-PI calves. Retrospective studies showed that only two of the 13 dams (15.4%) of non-PI calves had been inseminated once, which is a significantly (P < 0.001) lower rate than for 192 other gestations (66.7%) during the 3 year period. The gestational duration of multiparous cows (but not of heifers) was longer (P < 0.01) for five cows with PI calves (mean ± SD 287.6 ± 9.5 days) than for 53 other gestations in 35 cows (280.6 ± 3.8 days). Five of the 12 dams of the PI calves had not expelled the foetal membranes within 2 days after calving, which is a higher (P < 0.001) incidence than the seven cases of retained placenta observed after 198 other calvings. Furthermore, there was a 4.4-fold higher risk (P < 0.01) of treatment for enteritis and/or pneumonia in calves and a 6.0-fold higher risk of calf mortality associated with the introduction of BVDV. The mean heart girth of the PI calves was less (P < 0.05) than that of non-PI calves, at both 80 and 180 days of age.",1994-07-31,"Larsson, B.; Niskanen, R.; Alenius, S.",Animal Reproduction Science,,,True,custom_license

Fortunately, high-quality columns of every type described in this review are commercially available. Most water-soluble proteins may be eluted from size-exclusion, hydrophobic-interaction, ion-exchange, metal chelate, and bioaffinity columns with ease. When this is the case, high recovery and retention of biological activity are the norm. The exception is reversed-phase chromatography where the organic solvents and acids used in polypeptide elution denature many proteins. When problems do occur, they are generally the result of unique structural features of the protein. Very hydrophobic proteins have presented the biggest problem in that they are difficult to solubilize, particularly with retention of biological activity. It has been found that zwitterionic an non-ionic detergents are the most suitable solubilizing agents, but area has also been used in cases where hydrophobic interacts are not as strong. Unfortunately, there is still an element of trial-and-error in selecting the most suitable solubilizing agent. Heterogeneous glycosylation of proteins also presents a problem. Both neutral and charged monosaccharides can be incorporated into proteins through multiple steps at several sites. Thus, there is the potential in a sample for a large number of glycoprotein species which have the same polypeptide backbone and differing amounts of oligosaccharide. A problem arises when size-exclusion, ion-exchange, hydrophobic-interaction, reversed-phase and bioaffinity systems begin to discriminate between these very similar glycoprotein species. Chromatographic peaks can become very load, due to incomplete fractionation, and the polypeptide chain of interest can be associated with multiple peaks. The separation of glycoproteins requires much more study before logical procedures can be suggested for column selection and operation. Aggregated species are another class of proteins which present occasional problems. Multimeric proteins are adsorbed to sorbents by a series of forces, among which are hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic forces. These forces are also responsible for the maintenance of quaternary structure in proteins. When the same forces dominate both retention of protein structure and adsorption at the sorbent surface, the quaternary structure of the protein can be disrupted during elution. Very basic proteins also present a problem in some cases. Columns with residual negative charges, such as a silica-based reversed-phase column, adsorb anionic species so strongly that they are difficult to elute. This is the case with ribosomal and nucleoproteins. The solution is to use exhaustively end-capped columns which diminish electrostatic interactions.",1987-07-17,"Regnier, Fred E.",Journal of Chromatography B: Biomedical Sciences and Applications,,,True,custom_license

They consist of a bilayer of phospholipid molecules in which proteins are embedded. These integral membrane proteins, which cross the bilayer once or several times, generally have a higher than average hydrophobicity and tend to aggregate. Detergents are needed to remove integral membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer and they have to be present during further chromatographic purification. Predominantly, four modes of HPLC have been used alone or in combination for the puridication of integral membrane proteins. These are based on differences of proteins in size (size-exclusion chromatography, SEC), electrostatic interaction (ion-exchange chromatography, IEC), bioaffinity (bioaffinity chromatography, BAC) and hydrophobic interaction (reversed-phase chromatography, RPC, and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography, HIC). SEC, IEC, BAC and HIC are used under relatively mild conditions, and buffer systems generally contain a non-ionic detergent. RPC generally has a denaturing effect on the protein and should preferably be used for the purification of integral membrane proteins smaller than 50 kD.",1987-07-17,"Welling, Gjalt W.; Van der Zee, Ruurd; Welling-Wester, Sytske",Journal of Chromatography B: Biomedical Sciences and Applications,,,True,custom_license

Ad isolates of serotypes 1–7 grown in HEp-2 or primary rhesus monkey kidney cells were identified by neutralization. Graham 293 cell cultures were used only when specimens were found to be positive for Ad by EM, type-specific Ad40/41 EIA, and for isolates not identified by neutralization. Ads grown in 293 cells were identified by DNA restriction endonuclease analysis. Of the 1187 specimens examined, 105 (9%) were found to be positive for Ad. VC detected 93, while 12 additional positives were detected by EM or EIA. The relative sensitivity of VC, EIA, and EM for the 105 specimens was 89% (93), 45% (47), and 35% (37), respectively.

Morphological studies based on normal, mutant and experimentally-lesioned tissue have indicated that Schwann cells are only able to enter the CNS when the integrity of the astrocytic glia limitans is disrupted. The significance and subtlety of the interactions between Schwann cells and astrocytes have been further explored by glial cell transplantation studies. These studies support in vitro observations on Schwann cell behaviour in highlighting the importance of extracellular matrix for both migration and myelin sheath formation. The failure of Schwann cells to intermix with astrocytes is an important aspect of glial cell biology which will have a bearing on efforts to remyelinate demyelinated axons by Schwann cell-transplantation.",1993-10-31,"Franklin, R.J.M.; Blakemore, W.F.",International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience,,,True,custom_license

To further characterize the CNS cytokine network we investigated the differences in roles of these cells, and found that microglia might contribute to the early phase of cytokine production reaction and that astrocytes might contribute the late phase of the reaction. We also investigated roles of inhibitory cytokines such as TGF β, IL-4, and IL-10, and showed that each might play a distinct role in the inhibitory regulation in the CNS. We summarized our previous report about cellular distribution of cytokine receptors in the CNS cells and discussed their roles in the CNS cytokine network.

Distinctive five-fold vertices, usually appearing as darker spots on the capsid, were an additional feature of these particles. The capsid structure, which is skew, could readily be distinguished from the T = 25 capsid of adenovirus and the holey capsids of rotavirus and reovirus.

Negative staining with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) or uranyl acetate has facilitated the detection of many viruses in clinical specimens. Enhancement procedures have included the use of centrifugation and agar diffusion for concentrating virus particles, the use of solid phase capture reagents to trap virus particles and the use of secondary antibodies and electron dense markers to help visualize them. Techniques currently in use and employing negative staining include direct EM, immune electron microscopy (IEM), solid phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM), colloidal gold-labeled protein A (PAG), solid phase IEM employing a second decorator antibody (SPIEMDAT), and solid phase IEM using colloided gold-labeled secondary antibodies (SPEIMDAGT). IEM methods assist with the detection of small viruses or viruses present in low numbers while PAG offers increased sensitivity over direct EM and IEM. In our experience the serum-in-agar (SIA) method is the most sensitive of the PAG IEM techniques for detection of rotavirus particles in clinical specimens. SPIEMDAT enhances the detection of small viruses which are often missed by other techniques due to background staining in specimens. SPEIMDAGT employing colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibody has increased sensitivity and offers the advantage of detecting viral antigen when whole virus particles are not visible.

By 14 days after inoculation, the brains of all antibody-protected mice examined were nearly normal on histological examination. At 3–8 weeks post-inoculation, approximately 40% of the antibody-protected mice developed a neurological disease characterized by hindlimb paralysis and wasting. Evidence of inflammation and demyelination was apparent in the spinal cord and brainstem. The mice that remained asymptomatic at this time showed few signs of inflammation and none developed clinical disease over the following 9 months. Viral antigen could be detected in most of the mice examined at all times after inoculation, whether symptomatic or not, and was particularly evident in the animals with hindlimb paralysis. MHV-JHM could be consistently cultured from the mice with hindlimb paralysis. These results show that maternal immune factors can completely protect susceptible mice from the acute, fatal, clinical encephalomyelitis caused by MHV-JHM, but cannot prevent the establishment of a latent state and subsequent development of virus-induced, clinically evident, demyelinating disease.

Monoclonal antibodies J.7.2 and J.2.2 bind to topographically distinct sites on E2. NR variants selected with J.7.2, like parental JHMV, predominantly cause a fatal encephalitis when given intracerebrally to mice, while J.2.2-selected NR variants cause a subacute disease characterized by paralysis and severe demyelination. We report here that consecutive selection with both J.2.2 and J.7.2 monoclonal antibodies results in NR variants which are markedly attenuated in both encephalitic potential and ability to induce demyelination. Analysis of the different variants suggests that the subregion of E2 bound by monoclonal antibody J.7.2 may be a critical viral determinant of paralysis and demyelination in this model system.",1987-07-31,"Fleming, J.O.; Trousdale, M.D.; Bradbury, J.; Stohlman, S.A.; Weiner, L.P.",Microbial Pathogenesis,,,True,custom_license

MHV-JHM can be isolated from the brains and spinal cords of maternal antibody-protected mice when the late onset disease becomes clinically apparent, showing that the virus must be present in these mice when they are still asymptomatic. To determine which cells of the central nervous system (CNS) were potential reservoirs for the virus during the asymptomatic period, tissue sections were assayed simultaneously by immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence staining for the presence of viral antigen and for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astrocytes.2 The results indicate that 20% (range 0–52%) of the MHV-JHM infected cells in asymptomatic mice were astrocytes. In mice symptomatic with late onset hindlimb paralysis, a higher percentage of infected cells were astrocytes.

In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating diseases. III. JHM virus infection of rats. Arch Neurol 1980; 37: 478-84. Two types of studies were conducted to ascertain the involvement of the cellular immune system in development of resistance. Immunosuppression of WL rats with cyclosporin A (CsA) following onset of the age-related resistance demonstrated that this drug was partially able to abrogate resistance. In the other studies nude (rnu/rnu) rats, their heterozygous (rnu/+) litter mates and genetically related LE rats of various ages were challenged with JHMV. The rnu/+ and LE animals became completely resistant before the age of weaning, whereas some rnu/rnu rats, challenged as late as 70 days of age, showed disease symptoms—albeit after a long latent period. These observations indicated that the cellular immune system plays an important role in suppressing the disease process in the CNS. When the infection of nude rats was initiated on or after the 15th day of life, the histological lesions were generally small and present in both grey and white matter but were seldom seen in the spinal cord. Mononuclear infiltrates were evident throughout the CNS. In some nude rats there was massive mononuclear cell infiltration towards the meningies and into ventricular spaces. By contrast in rnu/+, LE and WL rats with late-onset disease symptoms, demyelinating-type lesions were confined to the white matter and only minor infiltration of mononuclear cells was evident. JHMV RNA was detectable by dot-blotting analysis in the CNS of both paralysed and asymptomatic rnu/rnu and rnu/+ rats, but less RNA was usually detected in heterozygous animals. In-situ hybridization with cDNA probes for JHMV RNA showed that neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum, as well as cells in the white matter, were frequently infected. The present data indicate that in the rat T cells have an important function in maintaining resistance to the JHMV related disease process. However, even without a functional T cell compartment nude rats challenged after 15 days of age did not develop an acute encephalitis, suggesting that an age-dependent, non-immunological mechanism is also involved in restricting the spread of infection. It is possible that resistance in euthymic rats sets in because: (1) at the time of weaning the CNS matures, so that the number of targets available for infection is reduced, (2) T cells prevent the late-onset disease by clearing persistent, low grade infections from the CNS.",1987-02-28,"Sorensen, O.; Saravani, A.; Dales, S.",Microbial Pathogenesis,,,True,custom_license

The infectious process in cyclosporin A treated Wistar Lewis rats inoculated with JHM virus,10.1016/0882-4010(89)90003-X,,2543885.0,els-covid,"Abstract In the present study we investigated age related effects of inoculum size and cellular immunity on the CNS disease caused by JHM virus (JHMV) in Wistar Lewis (WL) rats. Onset of resistance normally becomes evident by the 10th day when inoculation is made with 106 pfu or less. The resistance could be abrogated in 15 day old animals by increasing the dose two-fold, but with rare exceptions, in 35 day old rats an 80-fold increase in pfu fails to surmount resistance. However, treatment with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA) abolished resistance, whereby rats challenged at 35 days of age were susceptible to JHMV. The histopathological evidence and disease symptoms in the CsA treated group resembled closely those observed in our previous study with athymic, nude rats. Microscopic examination of the CNS from untreated, infected rats revealed extensive inflammatory responses characterized by perivascular cuffing and mononuclear infiltrates into the neuropile. The parallel CsA treated group showed that inflammatory responses of this type in the CNS were either minimal or absent. From the present evidence, we conclude that JHMV infection, which involves both neuronal and oligodendrocytic elements, is kept in check by the cellular immune system. When cellular immunity is suppressed or absent the disease process is altered from one in which white matter demyelination predominates to another form of disease in which neuronal involvement is prominent.",1989-01-31,"Zimmer, Mitchell J.; Dales, Samuel",Microbial Pathogenesis,,,True,custom_license

This increase in salmonella resistance was observed when the interval between MHV and salmonella infections was 6 days, but not at 3, 10, or 14 day intervals. The mouse lty locus, which controls the number of intracellular salmonella, had a significant effect on the ability of MHV to induce resistance to salmonella. MHV caused an increase in resistance to salmonella in lty s (salmonella susceptible) mice at all doses of salmonella tested (100 to 10000 cfu). In the lty r (salmonella resistant) mice tested the beneficial effect of MHV on salmonella resistance was small and when observed, was only present at salmonella doses of 10000 cfu or greater. Neither the Lps d nor Xid mutations affected the ability of MHV to increase resistance to salmonella infection. In contrast to euthymic mice, MHV infection greatly decreased the resistance of athymic (nude) mice to salmonella infection. Since the Nu locus does not affect the resistance of mice to salmonella (at 4 days post salmonella infection), these results indicate that MHV infection and the nude phenotype interact to increase susceptibility to salmonella. These findings re-emphasize the importance of keeping laboratory mice used in research free of MHV and other immunomodulatory pathogens.",1989-02-28,"Fallon, Michael T.; Schoeb, Trenton R.; Benjamin, William H.; Lindsey, J.Russell; Briles, David E.",Microbial Pathogenesis,,,True,custom_license

The CDV Cornell A75-17 strain produces a delayed, subacute to chronic, demyelinating CNS disease. In contrast, the Snyder Hill (CDV-SH) strain-associated neurological disease is more acute in onset, is usually non-demyelinating and primarily produces lesions in the gray matter. In these studies we describe the effects of these two virulent and one avirulent CDV strain, Rockborn (CDV-RO), on astrocytes in dissociated canine brain cell cultures. In multiple replicate experiments, astrocytes were infected most rapidly by CDV-RO [100% of astrocytes were infected by 14 days post-inoculation (pi.)]. This strain caused severe cytopathic effect (CPE) and cytolysis. CDV-SH similarly produced a rapid infection of the astrocytes. In contrast, CDV A75-17 infected less than 25% of the astrocyte population during the first 28 days p.i. (± 7 days); after 28 days p.i., a rapid rise in astrocyte infection occurred. Both virulent viruses caused astrocytic syncytial formation but did not cause cytolysis of the astrocyte population as was observed with the attenuated virus. Titers of infectious virus, released into the supernatant fluid, reflected the degree of astrocyte infection. Virus released by the cultures late in CDV A75-17 infection showed enhanced ability to infect newly derived astrocytes; in contrast, brain cell passaged CDV-SH did not show increased growth in these cells. These results show that (1) there is a difference in growth rate, CPE and capacity for adaptation of three different CDV strains in astrocytes in vitro, and (2) some aspects of the disease (such as persistence in white matter) produced by the virulent strains in vivo may be related to the course of astrocyte infection observed in vitro.",1990-01-31,"Pearce-Kelling, Susan; Mitchell, William J.; Summers, Brian A.; Appel, Max J.G.",Microbial Pathogenesis,,,True,custom_license

It has previously been shown that the adoptive transfer of 5 × 107 nylon wool adherent (NWA) spleen cells from immunized donors to lethally infected recipients clears virus from the central nervous system (CNS) and prevents demyelination. Adoptive transfer of a smaller number (1 × 107) of NWA spleen cells from immunized donors also protects from death but does not significantly alter virus replication in the CNS during the acute phase of the infection. Moreover, these mice develop a transient non-fatal encephalomyelitis which occurs approximately 3 weeks post-infection. This delayed encephalomyelitis is associated with a mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS but little or no evidence of virus replication or increased viral antigen. A virus-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response precedes this delayed onset of disease by 24 to 48 h. Resolution of disease correlates with a selective and permanent suppression of the JHMV-specific DTH reactivity. In addition, no virus-specific DTH is detected following adoptive transfer of viral-specific DTH effectors derived from immunized donors. In contrast, these mice respond to a heterologous antigen, KLH, suggesting that the resolution of the encephalitis is accompanied by a profound suppression in viral-specific DTH response.",1990-05-31,"Shubin, Richard A.; Sussman, Mark A.; Fleming, John O.; Stohlman, Stephen A.",Microbial Pathogenesis,,,True,custom_license

In contrast, infection of SJL/J mice results in acute encephalitis, virus persistence, and immune-mediated demyelination. These experiments examined the role of T-cell subsets in the in vivo immune response to Theiler's virus in resistant C57BL/10SNJ mice. Depletion of T-cell subsets with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed at CD3 (pan-T-cell marker), CD4+ (class II-restricted) or CD8+ (class I-restricted) T cells resulted in increased frequency of paralysis and death as a result of acute encephalitis. Neuropathologic studies 10 days after infection demonstrated prominent necrosis, primarily in the pyramidal layer of hippocampus and in the thalamus of mice depleted of T-cell subsets. In immunosuppressed and infected C57BL/10SNJ mice, analysis of spinal cord sections 35 days after infection demonstrated small demyelinated lesions relatively devoid of inflammatory cells even though virus antigen could be detected by immunocytochemistry. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are important in the resistance to infection with Theiler's virus in C57BL/10SNJ mice. However, subsequent spinal cord demyelination, to the extent observed in susceptible mice, depends on the presence of virus antigen persistence and a competent cellular immune response.",1991-10-31,"Rodriguez, Moses; Lindsley, Mark D.; Pierce, Mabel L.",Microbial Pathogenesis,,,True,custom_license

In situ hybridization of glial cell cultures infected with MHV-A59 again showed enhanced MHC mRNA expression, both in infected and uninfected cells. These results extend our earlier finding that MHC surface antigens are enhanced on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes after MHV-A59 infection and suggest that this enhancement is a result of an increase in the steady-state level of MHC mRNA. We further demonstrate that increases in MHC mRNA occur in the murine central nervous system (CNS) following infection in vivo. Northern blot analysis of RNA from the brains of infected animals showed transient expression of both MHC class I and class II mRNA over the first 14 days of infection. Expression coincided with viral replication and clearance. In situ hybridization of brain sections from infected animals showed that class I and class II expression was widespread throughout all portions of the brain and in uninfected as well as infected cells. Viral RNA, in contrast, was observed in small foci of cells and mostly within the limbic system. Thus enhancement of MHC mRNA was not restricted either to areas of infection or inflammation. The spatial relationship between viral and MHC expression supports our hypothesis that a soluble mediator is involved in the mechanism of the increase in MHC levels. The fact that MHC induction occurs in vivo as well as in vitro suggests MHC may be important in the mechanism of MHV-induced disease.",1992-12-31,"Gombold, James L.; Weiss, Susan R.",Microbial Pathogenesis,,,True,custom_license

Our previous work demonstrated that resistance by primary SJL/J glial cultures may involve events subsequent to viral gene expression, possibly due to a defect in cell-to-cell spread of the infection. Since S, the virion's major spike glycoprotein, is known to facilitate the spread of infection due to its syncytiogenic properties, we decided to investigate the role of this viral structural protein in resistance by primary SJL/J glial cells. Variants possessing deletions within the S coding region were able to grow in SJL/J glial cells 10–100 times easier and fuse five-times more efficiently than wt virus. Induction of neurologic disease in SJL/J mice following intracranial inoculation with either wt JHMV or the S deletion variant, AT11f cord, was age-dependent, occurring only in animals inoculated under 4 weeks of age. Resistance in older animals to wt and variant viruses could be abrogated by immunosuppression with cyclosporin A. However, both disease incidence and viral brain titers were higher in animals receiving the JHM variant AT11f cord virus, suggesting that SJL/J resistance to neurologic disease may manifest itself through interactions between inefficient cell-to-cell spread of the infection and protective aspects of the immune response.",1992-07-31,"Pasick, John M.M.; Wilson, Greame A.R.; Morris, Vincent L.; Dales, Samuel",Microbial Pathogenesis,,,True,custom_license

All the BALB/cHeA mice died within 2 weeks from acute encephalitis. In contrast, STS/A mice were shown to be partially resistant, with a mortality rate of 30%, longer survival times and lower rates of viral production. The mortality rates, survival times and viral titers of F1 hybrids and the RI strains varied, suggesting involvement of multiple genes. STS/A, F1 hybrid and RI mice surviving the acute infection occasionally developed severe paraparesis about 1 month post-infection. In these mice, vacuolar degeneration, astrocytosis, the absence of perivascular cuffing and minimal demyelination were found in the central nervous system. No infectious virus could be recovered from these mice. Although the paralysis of delayed onset was limited to STS/A, F1 hybrid and eight of the 13 RI strains, the incidence varied significantly among the RI strains. These results may suggest that JHMV-induced late disease is also under multifactorial control.

The sequence contains two open reading frames (ORFs) which are homologous to ORFs in corresponding regions of L1 elements in other species. The L1H8 ORFs are separated by a small evolutionarily nonconserved region. The 5′ end of the consensus contains frequent terminators in all three reading frames and has a relatively high GC content with numerous stretches of weak homology with AluI repeats. The 5′ ORF extends for a minimum of 723 bp (241 codons). The 3′ ORF is 3843 bp (1281 codons) and predicts a protein of 149 kD which has regions of weak homology to the polymerase domain of various reverse transcriptases. The 3′ end of the consensus has a 208-bp nonconserved region followed by an adenine-rich end. The organization of the L1H8 consensus sequence resembles the structure of eukaryotic mRNAs except for the noncoding region between ORFs. However, due to base substitutions or truncation most elements appear incapable of producing mRNA that can be translated. Our observation that individual elements cluster into subfamilies on the basis of the presence or absence of blocks of sequence, or by the linkage of alternative bases at multiple positions, suggests that most L1 sequences were derived from a small number of structural genes. An estimate of the mammalian L1 substitution rate was derived and used to predict the age of individual human elements. From this it follows that the majority of human L1 sequences have been generated within the last 30 million years. The human elements studied here differ from each other, yet overall the L1H8 sequences demonstrate a pattern of species-specificity when compared to the L1 families of other mammals. Possible mechanisms that may account for the origin and evolution of the L1 family are discussed. These include pseudogene formation (retroposition), transposition, gene conversion, and RNA recombination.",1987-10-31,"Scott, Alan F.; Schmeckpeper, Barbara J.; Abdelrazik, Mona; Comey, Catherine Theisen; O'Hara, Bruce; Rossiter, Judith Pratt; Cooley, Tim; Heath, Peter; Smith, Kirby D.; Margolet, Louise",Genomics,,,True,custom_license

Virus was optimally attached to nitrocellulose membranes when spotted in 1 × SSC, whereas 20 × SSC was superior for viral RNA. Denaturation and RNA fixation of both RNA, still encapsidated in virus particles and isolated genomic RNA, was achieved by baking of the blots in vacuum. Virus detection in the supernatant of infected HRT-18 cells was feasible, but improved significantly after proteinase K treatment. No homology was observed between virus cDNA with either plasmid DNA or nucleic acid isolated from non-infected HRT-18 cells. Hybridization with radioisotopic-labelled probes in higher formamide concentrations (up to 60%) increased the detection signals, possibly by reducing reassociation of the probe. Significant detection amplification (30–50 times) was achieved in the case of biotinylated probes by stimulation of hyperpolymer formation on already hybridized target sequences, by additional hybridization with biotinylated pUC-19. A detection amplification was also obtained when hybridization was done with two probes (pBC-52 and pBC-247), containing non-overlapping viral sequences.

Six radioactive probes were used to obtain adequate detection signals. These probes, containing the complete N and E1 gene sequences and other sequences, hybridized to about 1 4 of the total length of the viral RNA. Genomic RNA could be detected after direct spotting of samples, but prior Freo-nextraction or centrifugation of specimens on a cushion of sucrose improved considerably the positive identification of virus containing samples. RNA detection in positive clinical specimens was significantly better by hybridization than immunological detection of BCV by ELISA, although differences were slight after two passages of the virus on HRT-18 cell monolayers. Consequently, the reliability of positive and negative test results in hybridization tests on Freon extracted specimens was better than in ELISA. However, results after extraction with other organic solvents were inferior. The accuracy of ELISA was surpassed by hybridization assays.

The neurons were cultured in a two-chamber system allowing infection via the neuritic extensions exclusively. The effects of 30 MAbs on viral replication of the encephalitis-derived HSV-1 strain 2762 and its less neuroinvasive variant 2762p11 were assayed in this model. One MAb reactive with gD gave a nine-fold reduction of the virus yields of both strains. One MAb directed against gB gave an enhanced virus yield of strain 2762, but not of the 2762p11 variant. Another gB-reactive MAb decreased the virus yield of strain 2762p11, but not of 2762 after neuritic infection. The findings indicate that an alteration of gB has occurred during the passage of the strain 2762. Mutants of the same strain were derived by infecting hybridomas producing MAb reactive with gB, gC, gD and gE, respectively. The gB hybridoma mutant showed a significantly lower neuroinvasiveness in the DRG model, and was non-virulent after snout infection of mice. We suggest that the structure of gB of the strain 2762 is of importance for the neuroinvasiveness of this strain.",1992-02-29,"Bergström, T.; Sjögren-Jansson, E.; Jeansson, S.; Lycke, E.",Molecular and Cellular Probes,,,True,custom_license

Rats receiving the virus at 9 days of age had an extensive spread of infection throughout the brain and the animals died after a few days. Rats inoculated at day 11 postnatally survived and the infection was limited to the olfactory pathways, hypothalamus, diagonal bands and the anterior raphe nuclei. Stereological measurements showed that the volume of infected neurons constituted 67 ± 10% of the total neuronal volume in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Double-labelling experiments revealed that both 5-hydroxytryptamine- and substance P-immunoreactive neurons contained the virus antigen. The motor stimulant effect of amphetamine was studied at 3 months post infection. The increase in amphetamine-induced frequency and duration of rearing was significantly attenuated in infected rats and the amphetamine-induced locomotion was slightly reduced.",1993-02-28,"Andersson, Tommy; Mohammed, Abdul K.H.; Henriksson, Bengt G.; Wickman, Charlotte; Norrby, Erling; Schultzberg, Marianne; Kristensson, Krister",Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy,,,True,custom_license

Intrathecal administration of interleukin-1β and interferon-γ to rats results in a thermal hyperalgesia which peaks at 2 h post-injection but which is undetectable 8 h post-injection. Expression of mRNA for nitric oxide synthase type II (NOS II) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern hybridization utilizing specific oligonucleotides in spinal cord tissue from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection, but not at longer time points. NOS II protein was detected in soluble fractions of spinal cords from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection. In situ hybridization for NOS II mRNA revealed positive cells bilaterally in the spinal cord 4 h after cytokine injection in a perivascular distribution and scattered throughout the gray and white matter. Immunohistochemistry for NOS II showed a similar distribution which could only be partially accounted for by macrophages/microglia. These results provide evidence for induction of NOS II expression under conditions producing thermal hyperalgesia and suggest a possible role in this behavior for the production of NO by a variety of cell types in the CNS.",1996-06-30,"Grzybicki, D.; Gebhart, G.F.; Murphy, S.",Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy,,,True,custom_license

The present work addressed the effects of IDPN on tasks requiring the use of spatial information. Separate groups of male rats were dosed with IDPN (IP, in 1 ml/kg saline) for 3 consecutive days and tested in the following procedures: (a) step-through passive avoidance conditioning (0, 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg/day); (b) Morris water maze (MWM) acquisition and retention (0, 125, 150, 175, and 200 mg/kg/day); (c) radial arm maze (RAM) acquisition (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day); (d) RAM steady-state performance (0, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day); (e) repeated acquisition in the RAM (0, and 200 mg/kg/day). The vestibular toxicity of IDPN resulted in alterations in spontaneous behavior or swimming deficits in 5 of 8 rats treated with 175 mg/kg/day and in all the animals dosed with 200 or 400 mg/kg/day. IDPN increased step-through PA latencies at 200 mg/kg/day but not at lower doses. In the MWM, no performance deficits were observed at the dose levels preserving the swimming ability of the animals. In both the acquisition and the steady-state RAM tasks, IDPN (400 mg/kg/day) induced an increase in both choice errors and perseverative errors. In the RAM repeated acquisition paradigm, IDPN (200 mg/kg/day) induced performance deficits that included a decreased rate of within-session reduction in errors. The present data show that IDPN disrupts performance of tasks requiring spatial learning and memory and indicate that these deficits can be in part caused by an acquisition deficit.",1994-12-31,"Llorens, Jordi; Crofton, Kevin M.; Peele, David B.",Neurotoxicology and Teratology,,,True,custom_license

All animals belonged to a herd located in the mountains of the León province (NW Spain). Rotaviruses were found in 18 out of 63 goat kid fecal samples but no significant association between shedding of rotavirus and presence of diarrhea could be established. Rotaviruses were found in kids aged 6 to 21 days, and more frequently between 6 and 10 days. No shedding of virus was detected in any of the adults. Considering ELISA as the reference test, PAGE and both latex agglutination tests were less sensitive. One of the latex tests was also highly non-specific. All PAGE-positive samples showed the typical electropherotype of group A rotavirus. Feces were also screened for other pathogens including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Cryptosporidium parvum. C. parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of six out of 45 goat kids tested, all six suffering from diarrhea. This paper represents the first description of rotavirus infections in goats in Spain.

IPC were present in the non-adherent low-density cell subpopulation. Cell selection experiments using antibody (Ab)-coated immunomagnetic beads revealed that porcine IPC could be positively selected by anti-CD4 or -SLA-class-II Ab, but not by anti-CD2 or -CD8 Ab. The estimated IFN yield per IPC was found to increase when IPC were assayed at higher concentrations.

In retroviruses, synthesis of pol gene products necessitates either readthrough of a stop codon or frameshifting. Here we present an experimental system that permits quantification of translational errors in vivo. It consists of a family of expression vectors carrying different mutated versions of the luc gene as reporter. Mutations include both an in-frame stop codon and 1-base-pair deletions that require readthough or frameshift, respectively, to give rise to an active product. This system is sensitive enough to detect background errors in mammalian cells. In addition, one of the vectors contains two unique cloning sites that make it possible to insert any sequence of interest. This latter vector was used to analyse the effect of a DNA fragment, proposed to be the target of high level slippage at the gag-pol junction of HIV. The effect of paromomycin and kasugamycin, two antibiotics known to influence translational ambiguity, was also tested in cultured cells. The results indicate that paromomycin diversely affects readthrough and frameshifting, while kasugamycin had no effect. This family of vectors can be used to analyse the influence of structural and external factors on translational ambiguity in both mammalian cells and bacteria.",1990-12-31,"Cassan, M.; Berteaux, V.; Angrand, P.-O.; Rousset, J.-P.",Research in Virology,,,True,custom_license

Analysis of its secondary structure could not establish a simple transmembrane arrangement of the amino acids. Comparison of its nucleotide sequence with that of BECV Mebus strain showed only a two-base change resulting in a 100% homology between the two amino acid sequences.

Results: The improvements in Biotin-EIA featured four changes which increased sensitivity in the assay: (a) test diluent contained diethylenetriamino-pentaacetic acid; (b) antigen and biotinylated detector antibody were added simultaneously; (c) reaction time was extended from 1 h at 37°C to overnight at 4°C; (d) from the thirteen monoclonal antibodies used in TR-FIA, ten were optimal also in Biotin-EIA, but in the parainfluenza 1 and 2 assays other monoclonals proved more sensitive.

Time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA) has been developed for several viruses. Objectives: To prepare monoclonal antibodies to coronavirus strains, to incorporate them into a TR-FIA, and test the assay on clinical specimens. Study design: Monoclonal antibodies were prepared to the N nucleoprotein of the two human respiratory coronaviruses, HCV strains 229E and OC43. Monoclonals to both viruses were completely type-specific; they did not cross-react between themselves or with multiple strains of other respiratory viruses. These antibodies were configured into optimized EIA and TR-FIA tests.

Results: The all-monoclonal TR-FIA was uniformly the most sensitive, detecting virus in all 13 229E-positive specimens compared to 69% for the monoclonal EIA and 54% for the polyclonal EIA test.

For 229E in TR-FIA, mean positive/negative (P/N) ratios were 143 for 229E-positive human embryonic lung fibroblast (HLF) cell culture fluids and 10 for positive nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens; for OC43 in TR-FIA, mean P/N values were 964 for OC43-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell culture fluids and 174 for positive NPA specimens. The sensitivities of the TR-FIA were determined with purified virions to be 0.308 ng virus per well for HCV-229E and 0.098 ng virus per well for HCV-OC43. Conclusions: This rapid and sensitive test appears to be much more sensitive than traditional antigen detection assays but will require more extensive field testing on clinical specimens.",1994-06-30,"Hierholzer, John C.; Halonen, Pekka E.; Bingham, Patricia G.; Coombs, Richard A.; Stone, Yvonne O.",Clinical and Diagnostic Virology,,,True,custom_license

(ii) This technique can be applied to viral diagnosis in clinical samples. Objectives and study design: (i) To study the identification of six common respiratory viral pathogens by flow cytometry, in virus infected and uninfected cultured cells, as models of positive and negative clinical samples. (ii) To compare flow cytometry with the established techniques of viral isolation and immunofluorescent microscopy in the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection in 68 naso-pharyngeal aspirates taken from children and sent to the virology laboratory for routine virological diagnosis. Results: (i) For each virus analysed, populations of infected and non-infected cells were clearly discernable, confirming potential for this method in rapid viral diagnosis in clinical samples. (ii) Two definitions were employed for a sample to be positive by flow cytometry, these were compared with the combined established techniques. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of flow cytometry were 41%, 98%, 92% and 71% for the first definition and 74%, 88%, 80% and 84% for the second definition respectively. Conclusions: As tested in this study, flow cytometry is less sensitive than established techniques as well as recently developed rapid diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection.

A follow-up study,10.1016/0928-0197(96)00207-3,,,els-covid,"Abstract Background: Lowered yields of virus-induced interferon (IFN) by leukocyte cultures were previously suggested to be associated with recurrent respiratory infections in children (Pitkäranta et al. (1993) Clin. Diagn. Virol. 1, 101–108) Objectives: To investigate if the observed lowered IFN producing capacity was secondary to the underlying disease and, consequently, would be normalized after recovery of the child from the chain of infections. Study design: Forty-eight 3–12-year-old children suffering from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (acute otitis media included) were followed-up for 2 years. Their clinical condition and virus-induced interferon production in cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes were examined at the beginning and end of this period. Results: In 24 children the health improved strikingly during the follow-up, in 12 children a mild improvement took place, while 12 children remained constantly ill. IFN yields in cultures stimulated with corona- and respiratory syncytical viruses improved along with the clinical situation of the children. Parallel cultures induced with adeno-, influenza A or rhinoviruses did not show a similar correlation. Conclusion: These results suggest that the relationship between interferon production by leukocyte cultures and recurrent infections is complex and may be virus-specific.",1996-06-30,"Pitkäranta, Anne; Karma, Pekka; Hovi, Tapani",Clinical and Diagnostic Virology,,,True,custom_license

All of these advances have contributed to new or improved possibilities for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections. Objectives and study design: This review summarizes our experiences during the last 15 years in the development of diagnostic tests for respiratory virus infections, and in use of these tests in daily diagnostic work and in epidemiological studies. Results: Immunofluorescence tests based on monoclonal antibodies, all-monoclonal TR-FIAs, and biotin-enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) have about the same sensitivities and specificities. They compare well with the sensitivity of virus culture. PCR followed by liquid-phase hybridization is a sensitive method for detecting adenovirus DNA and enterovirus and rhinovirus RNA in clinical specimens. IgG EIA on paired acute and convalescent phase sera is the most sensitive serological test for respiratory virus infections and is a valuable reference method when evaluating the sensitivity of new diagnostic tests. The IgG avidity test can distinguish primary infections from re-infections at least in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. IgM antibody assays, on the other hand, had low sensitivities in our studies. Conclusions: The choice of diagnostic methods for respiratory virus infections depends on the type and location of the laboratory, the number of specimens tested, and the previous experience of the laboratory. Virus culture, whenever possible, should be the basic diagnostic method; the results, including identification of the virus, should be available no more than 24 h later than the results of rapid diagnostic tests. In small laboratories, especially in hospitals where specimen transportation is well organized, immunofluorescence may be the best choice for antigen detection with the provision that an experienced microscopist and a good UV microscope are available. If the laboratory receives a large number of specimens and has previous experience with EIAs, then biotin-EIAs or TR-FIAs may be the most practical techniques. Their advantages include the stability of the antigens in clinical samples since intact, exfoliated epithelial cells are not required, treatment of specimens is practical, testing of large numbers of specimens is possible, and reading the printed test result is less subjective than reading fluorescence microscopy. The larger role of PCR in the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections depends on future developments such as practical methods to extract DNA or RNA and to purify the extracts from nonspecific inhibitors, plus further improvements to minimize cross-contamination. Group-specific detection of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses is an example of the potential for PCR technology. In experienced laboratories. EIA IgG antibody tests should be available. Recombinant antigens may be a useful part of such assays.",1996-05-31,"Halonen, Pekka; Herholzer, John; Ziegler, Thedi",Clinical and Diagnostic Virology,,,True,custom_license

Even in developed countries, infectious enteritis is second only to respiratory infections as a cause of morbidity in early childhood. Objective: To nominate the various viral agents that cause enteritis, discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, epidemiology and diagnostic procedures employed. Study design: Pertinent literature was reviewed and the findings of investigations carried out on viral enteritis by various colleagues recalled. Results: The viruses causing gastroenteritis include: Rotaviruses; Adenoviruses-especially Ad 31, Ad 40 and Ad 41; members of the Caliciviridae, e.g. Norwalk virus, Hawaii virus, Snow Mountain virus, Taunton virus, Southampton virus, Toronto virus (formerly mini-reovirus) and others; Astrovirus; Coronavirus; Torovirus; Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and possibly Picobirnavirus. Enteritis-producing viruses replicate in columar epithelial cells in the distal parts of villi of the small intestine. Two mechanisms are addressed to explain why diarrhea occurs. Clinically, the main expression of illness is a watery diarrhea that lasts 24 h to about 7 days. Vomiting is of shorter duration and may not always accompany the diarrhea. Fever is generally ⩽ 38.5°C. Virus is shed in the stool for about 3–7 days. Diagnostic procedures employ electron microscopy (EM), immune electron microscopy (IEM), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA), latex agglutination, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conclusion: In developed countries viral enteritis among young children may be up to three times more common than bacterial gut disease. With the exception of CMV enteric involvement, the stool is characteristically not bloody and white blood cells are not found. Patient management may involve the employment of IV replacement therapy to counter dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

Following the application of these wastes to land the potential exists for environmental contamination. Plants, soil and ultimately water courses which may subsequently be used as catchments for public water supplies may all be affected. Research attention is now being focused on this possibility, especially in the case of protozoan pathogens which may be the most important as they are often resistant to current methods used in public water treatment. In this review we highlight some of the many factors that are likely to influence the degree of pollution by their effect on both the vertical and horizontal transport of microorganisms through soil. Soil pH, temperature, the presence of plants, microbial surface properties, type of waste, soil type and soil water content and flow may all affect the rate and extent of vertical transport, with the latter two generally considered to be the most important. Lateral movement is a particular problem in soils with impermeable substrata or in waterlogged conditions and in these cases the major factors affecting movement include rainfall rate, topography of the land and the rate at which microorganisms partition into the runoff.",1995-03-31,"Mawdsley, Jane L.; Bardgett, Richard D.; Merry, Roger J.; Pain, Brian F.; Theodorou, Michael K.",Applied Soil Ecology,,,True,custom_license

In these areas, up to 25% of children may never reach their fifth birthday. In addition, although the impact on growth and nutritional status is difficult to quantify, the cumulative toll on overall child health is enormous.

It causes impaired transit of intestinal contents and is determined by abnormalities of motor activity. The term CIP is used to indicate a heterogeneous group of disorders with many different pathogenic mechanisms. The defect in the regulation of intestinal transit can be at any level of motility control. Two main types of CIP are recognized, termed respectively myogenic (when smooth muscle cells are affected) and neurogenic (caused by abnormalities of extrinsic and/or intrinsic nervous supplies). Both types may be secondary to a variety of recognizable diseases or idiopathic. In myogenic CIP, intestinal transit is impaired because of lack of propulsive strength; in the neurogenic form, contractions are powerful but not sufficiently co-ordinated to propel intestinal contents aborally in an organized fashion. CIP belongs to the large and loosely defined group of digestive functional disorders. These disorders probably share common pathogenic mechanisms but with different expressiveness. The reasons why only some patients present recurrent symptomatological bouts resembling mechanical occlusion has not been clarified. This aspect is of great clinical relevance and deserves attention, as CIP patients, unlike other patients with severe functional disorders, may undergo repeated, useless and potentially dangerous operations. The diagnosis of CIP may be suggested by clinical features and is based on radiological, endoscopic, manometric, and histological findings. Recent technological improvements facilitate the recognition of this intriguing syndrome. In particular, manometric recording of the small bowel motility, which has long been considered an important research technique, can now also be regarded as a useful diagnostic tool.",1988-01-31,"Stanghellini, Vincenzo; Corinaldesi, Roberto; Barbara, Luigi",Baillière's Clinical Gastroenterology,,,False,custom_license

There are now thought to be four major subclassifications of gastroenteritis-causing viruses; these include rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, calicivirus, including Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses, and astrovirus. The association of these agents with gastroenteritis has been made by their electron microscopic detection in stool and intestinal biopsy specimens from affected patients, the inability to detect the viruses after recovery from disease, and the subsequent development of immunoglobulin responses after infection; in some instances disease transmission was achieved in human volunteers. The association of these viral agents with gastroenteritis has facilitated the study of classification, epidemiology, immunity, diagnostic tests, methods of treatment and, most importantly, disease prevention strategies such as vaccine development for rotavirus. This chapter highlights the major features of these agents, with special attention being given to the pertinent molecular biology as well as current and future prospects for vaccination.

Taken together, these data suggest that clearance of autoimmune inflammation in the nervous system is accomplished by the destruction of the antigen-specific T-cell population within the lesions.

Crystallographic studies of 21 such helices have indicated that these interactions are similar to those described for soluble proteins. Helix-helix interactions are also important in the oligomerization of a number of proteins that have a single transmembrane α-helix. The interactions are rather specific, involving interhelical salt bridges, hydrogen bonds or precise packing interactions. In some cases, such oligomerization is required for exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. The transmembrane helices of some Golgi-residing proteins also contain sufficient information to ensure their retention in this compartment. Finally, interactions between transmembrane α-helices may be important in the mechanism of transmembrane signalling by a number of membrane-bound receptors.",1992-08-31,"Lemmon, Mark A.; Engelman, Donald M.",Current Opinion in Structural Biology,,,False,custom_license

Such a structure could result from a two-stage folding process, during which preformed transmembrane helices with independent stability pack without topological rearrangement. This view was originally prompted by experiments in which fragments of transmembrane regions were separately refolded into lipid bilayers and subsequently brought together to yield a functional protein. Other lines of evidence, including the existence of ‘one-helix’ miniproteins, gene-fusion experiments, helix-driven oligomerization of bitopic proteins, and sequence rearrangements in the course of evolution support this view. Although it forms a useful basis for structural predictions, the limitations of the two-stage folding hypothesis are not clearly defined, and the proportion of integral membrane proteins to which it applies remains uncertain. The papers discussed in the present review illustrate recent progress along these lines.",1993-08-31,"Popot, Jean-Luc",Current Opinion in Structural Biology,,,True,custom_license

Viral infections of cultivated shellfish, crustacea, and finfish have been frequently recognized in the past few years. In the Asian regions, penaeid shrimp and several teleost fish underwent epizootics associated with heavy losses in aquaculture. Baculoviruses are particularly harmful to shrimp and prawns. Herpes-, irido-, reo-, or rhabdovirus-like agents can cause outbreaks in fish farms. Viral diseases are important limiting factors in the expansion of aquaculture. However, studies on viral infections of aquatic animals have been focused primarily on economically important farmed fish. Therfore, certain viral diseases of teleost fish are relatively well understood. In contrast, our knowledge of viral infections of farmed aquatic invertebrates is still very spare. Although a great number of viruses have been detected in farmed molluscs and crustaceans, the pathogenicity and epizootiology of most of the agents is not known.",1994-12-31,"Ahne, W.",Annual Review of Fish Diseases,,,True,custom_license

The generation and maintenance of this diversity is achieved by the targeting of newly synthesized proteins to specific locations and their subsequent retention there. Sequences that retain proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have been identified at the C-termini of resident ER proteins, where they are readily accessible to potential receptors. By contrast, recent results have demonstrated that retention of proteins in the Golgi complex involves sequences located within transmembrane domains.

Emphasis is initially placed upon the bone osteoclast, the skeletal muscle myotube and the placental syncytiotrophoblast. The widespread occurence of MNGCs in a range of pathological situations is discussed, with emphasis upon the broad involvement of the macrophage in inflammatory responses. Many viruses produce cell fusion in vivo and in vitro when cell cultures are infected. Several examples are given. A clear distinction is drawn between viral fusion from “without” and viral fusion from “within” the cell. The cytopathic effect (CPE) of the animal and human retroviruses is discussed in considerable detail. The in vivo and in vitro formation of lymphocytic and macrophage MNGCs by HIV-1 is given extensive coverage. The possible significance of the presence of brain MNGCs of macrophage/microglial origin as a cellular feature of AIDS dementia is discussed. A new hypothesis is advanced relating to the possible role of endogenous C-type retrovirus in the physiological fusion of the invasive placental cytotrophoblasts to create the syncytiotrophoblast. The evolutionary and developmental significance of such an event in relation to the evolution of the placental mammals is discussed. The possible importance of MNGC formation in the depletion of the CD4+ population of T-lymphocytes in vivo in the clinical progression of the AIDS-related complex and AIDS is related to the potent fusogenic effect of HIV-1 when cell cultures are infected.",1993-12-31,"Harris, J.R.",Micron,,,True,custom_license

First, both glial and neuronal cells normally do not express molecules of the major histocompatibility complex. Second, the most efficient cells for stimulating an immune response (leucocyte dendritic cells) are not present in the healthy CNS; and third, there is no specialized lymphatic drainage from the CNS to lymph nodes to enable the immune system to be quickly informed of the presence of an infection. Nevertheless, the immune system apparently copes with the vast majority of viral infections in the CNS. This is clearly evidenced by the reactivation of latent CNS viral infections in some immunosuppressed patients and the dramatic increase in the seventy of CNS disease in young or otherwise immunologically incompetent experimental animals infected with neurotropic viruses.

The chronic infection is also dependent on the mouse strain used, with susceptibility linked in part to the D locus of the MHC. The region of the virus genome associated with neurovirulence maps to the P1 region, encoding the capsid proteins, and to the 5′ non-coding region. There is evidence that BeAn DA virus persists in oligodendrocytes, where it reactivates to initiate demyelinating disease. Host factors are involved in the development of the lesion, including CD4+ T cell responses. These lymphocytes most probably mediate damage through activation of macrophages leading to local destruction of glial cells. Another possible pathological role for the immune system is the recognition of nerve cell antigens and the initiation of autoimmune disease.

The printed results were expressed in ELISA units. The ELISA results obtained on 370 cattle sera were compared with those of the serum neutralisation test (SNT). An agreement of 90·5% was obtained when reciprocal SNT titres equal to or greater than 4 and IgG ELISA units equal to or greater than 50 were taken as indicative of a specific reaction. Of the 370 sera, 35 gave discrepant results of which 21 were SNT positive/IgG ELISA negative and 14 were SNT negative/IgG ELISA positive. When the SNT positive sera negative in the IgG ELISA were tested in an IgM ELISA, 19 were found to be positive. Thus, when the IgG and IgM ELISA results were combined the overall agreement between the ELISA and SNT increased to 95·7%. The IgG ELISA had a sensitivity of 82·4% and specificity of 94·4% relative to the SNT, whereas the combined IgG and IgM ELISA results gave a sensitivity and specificity of 98·3% and 94·4% respectively.

A Gammacell 220 (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd., Ottawa, Canada § § Use of trade names is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by the Public Health Service or by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ) was used to subject 38 viruses grown in either susceptible tissue cultures or embryonated chicken eggs to various doses of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 source. The radiation required to reduce viral infectivity was 0·42 to 3·7 megarads (Mrad). The effect of gamma treatment on the antigenic reactivity of reagents for the complement fixation (CF), hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminadase assays was determined. Influenza antigens inactivated with 1·7 Mrad displayed comparable potency, sensitivity, specificity and stability to those inactivated by standard procedures with beta-propiolactone (BPL). Significant inactivation of influenza N1 and B neuraminidase occurred with >2·4 Mrad radiation at temperatures above 4°C. All 38 viruses were inactivated, and CF or HA antigens were prepared successfully. Antigenic potency remained stable with all antigens for 3 years and with 83% after 5 years storage. Influenza HA antigens evaluated after 9 years of storage demonstrated 86% stability.

In this study, the potential RNA pseudoknots just downstream from the known and suspected retroviral frameshift sites were predicted in the Rous sarcoma virus, primate immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV), equine infectious anemia virus, visna virus, bovine leukemia virus, human T-cell leukemia virus (types I and II), mouse mammary tumor virus, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, and simian SRV-1 type-D retrovirus. Also, the putative RNA pseudoknots were detected in the gag-pol overlaps of two retrotransposons of Drosophila, 17.6 and gypsy, and the mouse intracisternal A particle. For each sequence, the thermodynamic stability and statistical significance of the secondary structure involved in the predicted tertiary structure were assessed and compared. Our results show that the stem-loop structures in the pseudoknots are both thermodynamically highly stable and statistically significant relative to other such configurations that potentially occur in the gag-pool or gag-pro and pro-pol junction domains of these viruses (300 nucleotides upstream and downstream from the possible frameshift sites are included). Moreover, the structural features of the predicted pseudoknots following the frameshift site of propol overlaps of the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 retroviruses are structurally well conserved. The occurence of eight compensatory base changes in the tertiary interaction of the two related sequences allow the conservation of their tertiary structures in spite of the sequence divergence. The results support the possible control mechanism for frameshifting proposed by Brierley et al. [1] and Jacks et al.

Many other companies engage in providing traditional big pharma or other SMEs with technologies and services. Hundreds of such companies have arisen, many clustered around centres of academic excellence on the coasts of the USA, or in certain regions in Europe and Asia – such clustering of scientific prowess has changed the location of where even big pharma tends to perform its research. By 2006, a large proportion (but generally less than 50%) of new drugs could be track to an origin in an SME, trends indicate that the proportion will rise even though the common prediction that large pharma will abandon internal research in favour of in-licensing from SMEs remains far from reality.",2007-12-31,"Newton, C.G.",Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry II,,,True,custom_license

Drugs are powerful substances with a great capacity to cause harm if misused or overused. Even when used correctly, pharmaceuticals can elicit disputes about their relative harms and benefits in specific situations. The establishment of modern intermediaries – physicians or pharmacists – in the allocation of the most powerful drugs increases the potential for conflict between those who control the resource and those who desire access to it. The size and influence of the pharmaceutical–industrial complex places disproportionate power in those whose interests lie in promoting and expanding pharmaceutical use in society. The expense of certain drugs complicates equitable allocation, and the concentration of pharmaceutical power in Western, industrialized countries promotes research and drug discovery disproportionately for diseases that are prevalent in the wealthier nations. The increasing sophistication of drug action challenges the traditional model of using drugs as a means to treat pathological conditions and processes, and raises the specter of lifestyle and enhancement uses of pharmaceuticals. New means of drug discovery – such as the use of stem cells – have elicited debate about the relative values placed on the status of the embryo and the potential treatment for intractable conditions that could result from stem cell research. Finally, the overall emphasis on drugs as the first line defense against what ails us has provoked some societal soul-searching. In this chapter, we review some of the ethical issues attendant to drug production and distribution, including issues of safety, justice, economic inequality, and the changing demands for drugs that exceed therapeutic uses.

Much work over the last decade has been devoted to exploring the origins of false-positive screening hits, and ligand promiscuity has emerged as one such cause. Well-known mechanisms of promiscuity include reactive species and privileged substructures. More recently, it has been found that some nonspecific screening hits form aggregates of 30–1000nm in diameter. It has been proposed that these aggregate particles are responsible for the promiscuous behavior of many false positives and that aggregate-forming compounds may be widespread among screening hits.

It is characterized by wheeze, respiratory distress, and poor feeding. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause for bronchiolitis and is amongst the most important pathogens causing respiratory infection in infants worldwide. The healthcare burden of bronchiolitis is large, due to large numbers of hospitalized infants and the high risk of nosocomial spread during epidemics. Most children will suffer only mild, short-lived symptoms. A small proportion will need admission to hospital, where treatment is generally supportive until the illness resolves. Some will require ventilatory support for which mortality can be up to 10%. Infants at high risk of severe disease include those born prematurely, those with chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised infants. RSV infects ciliated epithelial cells, causing sloughing of the epithelium, cytokine and inflammatory mediator release, increases in mucus production, and interstitial edema. Clinical manifestations of bronchiolitis are a combined result of viral toxicity and the immune response to infection. Innate immune responses are important to the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis, as severe infection tends to occur after maternal antibody protection has waned and before the infant's adaptive immune responses have matured. Immunoprophylaxis, in the form of intramuscular anti-RSV IgG1, is effective in reducing rates of hospitalization for high-risk infants.",2006-12-31,"Smyth, R.L.; Brearey, S.P.",Encyclopedia of Respiratory Medicine,,,True,custom_license

Acute inhalation injuries may present as inhalation fever or as acute tracheobronchitis and pneumonitis. Occupational asthma is the most frequent work-related respiratory disease. It may be caused by allergic sensitization to macromolecules of biologic origin or to chemicals of low molecular weight, as well as by (heavy) exposure to workplace irritants. The pneumoconioses are caused by the accumulation of dust particles or fibres in the lungs. They include silicosis, coal workers’ pneumoconioses, asbestosis and other less common pneumoconioses. Chronic beryllium disease is caused by a cell-mediated sensitization to beryllium and resembles sarcoidosis. Hard-metal lung disease is caused by sensitivity to cobalt and resembles hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis is generally caused by sensitization to aerosolized biological antigens. Several types of infections may be related more or less specifically to work. Chronic obstructive lung disease is mainly caused by cigarette smoking, but exposure to dusts and gases contribute to its incidence. Similarly, bronchopulmonary cancer is not only caused by smoking, but also by occupational agents, most notably asbestos.

Pneumonia results from the proliferation of microorganisms at these sites in combination with the host response to the presence of microorganisms. A variety of pneumonia syndromes can be defined based on microbial etiology, underlying host defenses, clinical presentation, and site of acquisition. Because of the non-specific nature of the signs and symptoms, the diagnosis of pneumonia rests disproportionately on the presence of an infiltrate on chest radiograph. The frequent lack of a microbiologic diagnosis and the non-specificity of signs, symptoms, and radiographic infiltrates leads to frequent consideration of pneumonia in the differential diagnosis of many other pulmonary diseases. The etiologic spectrum of all types of pneumonia always includes the common community-acquired pathogens, with the spectrum broadening in response to either increasing immunocompromise or greater exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. While new or previously unrecognized pathogens can play a role in management decisions, the major issue in pneumonia is the appearance of antibiotic resistant strains of known common bacterial pathogens. Lack of even minimally effective agents is more the issue for nonbacterial pneumonias. Immunomodulation, in the form of less immunosuppressive cancer and transplant chemotherapy, immunization, or specific immunomodulatory drugs holds some hope for improving pneumonia outcome in the future.",2006-12-31,"Wunderink, R.G.; Mutlu, G.M.",Encyclopedia of Respiratory Medicine,,,True,custom_license

Atypical pathogens lack cell walls and are resistant to β-lactam antibiotics but are usually susceptible to tetracyclines, macrolides, ketolides, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. In this article, we also review other unusual causes of pneumonia which are transmitted by insects or vectors (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever, cat scratch fever, Q fever, ehrlichiosis, Lyme disease, and tularemia).

Other common pathogens include atypical organisms (Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae), Hemophilus influenzae, enteric Gram-negatives (especially in those with chronic illness and aspiration risk factors), and Staphylococcus aureus. Successful management requires careful assessment of disease severity so that a site-of-care decision can be made (outpatient, inpatient, intensive care unit), appropriate samples for diagnostic testing collected, and antibiotic therapy initiated in a timely and accurate fashion. Initial antibiotic therapy is empiric, but even with extensive diagnostic testing, less than half of all patients have an etiologic pathogen identified. All patients with CAP require therapy for pneumococcus, atypical pathogens, and other organisms, as dictated by the presence of specific risk factors.

In general, there are no reliable clinical or radiological features to distinguish viral from other causes of pneumonia. Respiratory viruses often show seasonality and a predilection for certain host groups. These epidemiological features are helpful in gauging the differential diagnoses. Confirmation of infection relies on laboratory investigations based on conventional approaches including direct viral antigen detection by specific monoclonal antibodies, virus isolation, and serology, as well as modern molecular approaches to amplify viral nucleic acid present in clinical specimens.

The superfamily consists so far of four distinct types of molecules ranging from the simpler low-molecular-weight type I and II cystatins, which function primarily to inhibit lysosomal cysteine proteinases (CPs), to the higher-molecular-weight type III and IV cystatins, which possess additional latent functions expressed only during episodes of injury and inflammation, or have evolved entirely novel inhibitory functions. The role cystatins play in respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD is poorly understood. However, they do modulate the immune response by acting directly on neutrophils, macrophages, and antigen presenting cells. It is also clear that they do not function independently of other proteolytic pathways involved in remodeling of the lung. Limited proteolysis inactivates cystatins allowing lysosomal CP activity to directly contribute to lung tissue degradation and also liberates kinins which signal through G-protein-coupled receptors to cause both constriction and dilation of the bronchioles, pain via stimulation of sensory nerves, mucus secretion, cough, and edema.",2006-12-31,"Pemberton, P.A.",Encyclopedia of Respiratory Medicine,,,True,custom_license

World Health Organization initiatives target acute respiratory diseases in infancy and early childhood with novel immunization approaches. Effective vaccines are needed urgently for viral respiratory diseases, but progress has been disappointingly slow.

The natural history of COPD is punctuated by episodes of acute deterioration in respiratory health termed exacerbations. Exacerbations are responsible for much of the morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with COPD, and also affect the rate of decline in lung function. Most exacerbations are caused by episodes of tracheobronchial infection. The clinical features comprise a worsening in symptoms beyond usual day-to-day variation. Examination may reveal tachypnea and signs of respiratory failure. Pathologically, exacerbations are associated with an increase in airway and systemic inflammation which, at least in more severe disease, is predominantly neutrophilic. Simple investigations are indicated to exclude differential diagnoses and assess exacerbation severity. Treatment aims to support respiratory function whilst drugs aimed at the underlying cause are able to act. The cornerstone of therapy is inhaled bronchodilators, with oral corticosteroids in all but the mildest exacerbations. Antibiotics are indicated if there has been a change in the character of the sputum. Some patients with respiratory failure will require supplemental oxygen or assisted ventilation.

Since human beings learned to domesticate cattle about 10,000 years ago, nonhuman mammalian milk also has been used to supplement or replace maternal milk in the human infant. The development and widespread use of commercially prepared infant formula products have been phenomena of the 20th century and notably of the past 6 decades. Additional information acquired during the last several years has reinforced existing concepts on the role of breast-feeding in protecting the infant against infections, in providing an ideal source of infant nutrition, in modulating infectious immune responses, and in suppressing the evolution of neoplasms and autoimmune disease later in life. 1 Over the past few decades, the immune responses on intestinal and respiratory mucosal surfaces to local infections have been intensely studied. These investigations have led to the development of concepts of immunity on mucosal surfaces of gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts and identification of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and local mechanisms of defense that are distinct from the internal (systemic) immune system. This chapter reviews existing information on major aspects of the physiologic, nutritional, immunologic, and anti-infective components of the products of lactation. Also discussed is the most recent evidence on the contribution of human milk to the development of immunologic integrity in the infant and its influence on the outcome of infections and other host-antigen interactions in the neonate.",2006-12-31,"Ogra, Pearay L.; Rassin, David K.; Garofalo, Roberto P.",Infectious Diseases of the Fetus and Newborn Infant,,,True,custom_license

It is not sufficient to examine tourism education without considering the progression of individuals that undertake tourism studies with a possible view to entering employment and developing their careers in the industry. Furthermore, given the amount of employment opportunities available in the various tourism sectors and the ability of tourism development to generate jobs, tourism education is often the starting point in the training and development of human capital to undertake these occupations.

Spatial diffusion theory distinguishes between two dimensions of a diffusion process. On the one hand, the routes may be determined by proximity – spreading to nearby places – or by hierarchical levels – spreading between places in a stepwise manner. On the other hand, the structure of diffusion appears as either expansion or relocation. The geographical context of health and disease can be conceived as epidemiological landscapes or landscapes of exposure. These are dynamic, i.e., their contents and extensions will change over time. The epidemiological transition might appear as a spatial diffusion of diseases, but is rather the outcome of changing ecological preconditions for disease and disease determinants. Increasing spatial connectivity has radically altered the routes and speed of diffusion. Global and local environmental changes alter the prospects for health. In the future, climatic change might affect the living conditions for agents and vectors involved in disease ecology. Understanding the geographical diffusion of diseases is important for predicting and containing diseases.

This article treats four broad frameworks engaged by geographers, each providing distinct conceptual insights about society and space. In the first, a Marxist view of inequity, society–space is a ‘structured coherence’ – a sociospatial formation, whose territorial boundaries approximate politicojuridical boundaries. Geographers' work on the sociospatial dialectic, spatial fix, and time–space compression have leavened understandings of the spatial dynamics in this approach. The second, a post-structuralist/Foucauldian approach, sees society–space as a ‘strategic field’. Space forms part of the technology of governance that constitutes subjects either as normal/abnormal, legal/illegal, or through states of exception – such as the enemy noncombatant or the illegal alien. In the third, a post-structuralist/feminist approach, society–space is seen as a ‘performative field’ in which subjects negotiate doubled positions and paradoxical spaces – affording insights into larger societal constructs such as the gendering of public/private spheres; racialized people's passing in a white world; or transsexuals performance of sexuality. In the fourth, a Deleuzian approach, society–space is an ‘immanent field’ in which subjects continuously transform themselves, hybridizing, engaging in acts of conjunction, connection, or collaboration with their milieu. Society–space is understood as stabilizing from the composite lattice of practices that are coded and channeled into a kind of social machine.",2009-12-31,"Ruddick, S.M.",International Encyclopedia of Human Geography,,,True,custom_license

Within the brain renin, some questions remain as to how the precursor, angiotensinogen, and its processing enzymes interact to produce the active compounds, angiotensin II/III, because they are rarely localized to the same brain nucleus let alone the same cell. These questions aside, there is clear evidence for actions of angiotensin peptides in regions behind the blood–brain barrier. Receptors for angiotensin peptides, including AT1 and AT2 receptors, are distributed in a characteristic pattern throughout the brain, with many of these sites behind the blood–brain barrier. Stimulation of these receptors affects multiple physiological functions – actions which often complement the physiological roles established for the systemic renin–angiotensin system. These include effects on fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, autonomic and neuroendocrine regulation, and modulation of sensory function. Moreover, administration of selective receptor antagonists attenuates several of these functions when they are activated in response to physiological stimuli, such as dehydration. Together, these observations point to important roles for brain-derived angiotensin peptides in a wide range of physiological functions.",2009-12-31,"Allen, A.M.; O’Callaghan, E.L.; Mendelsohn, F.A.O.; Chai, S.-Y.",Encyclopedia of Neuroscience,,,True,custom_license

Migratory bats have lower levels of population subdivision and larger genetically effective population sizes than nonmigratory bats. A variety of methods, including banding, genetic analyses, stable isotope analyses, and tracking with radio or satellite transmitters, are currently being used to study bat migration. The conservation of migratory bats poses special challenges that require national and international efforts. Migratory bats sometimes harbor pathogens that can be transmitted to humans.

Projects tend to have some commonalities that allow most of them to be divided up into several bins, if the bins are made large enough.. The term target validation can mean different things to different people. To a chemist proposing a new project it might refer to affirmative evidence from a mouse knockout or even just an RNA interference experiment in cells. To a clinician it probably means no less than proven statistically significant efficacy by a drug in large-scale, controlled human trials. Target validation, that is, systematically building up evidence that the interaction of a proposed target with an agent like a small molecule or a monoclonal antibody (mAB) can have a therapeutic effect in a human disease state, is often far from trivial. It represents an ongoing, labor-intensive process that can be rate-limiting, but is necessary to avoid disastrous losses in time, money, and manpower that occur when a clinical drug fails to work because its target is not at all crucial to disease progression or symptoms. Target identification, in this case the process whereby a new target is first proposed based on some minimal evidence, is less cumbersome but still requires devoted resources. The beauty of working on a project based upon an already established target is that both of these steps can be skipped.",2008-12-31,"Rydzewski, Robert M.",Real World Drug Discovery,,,True,custom_license

The testis and the male reproductive tract provide an environment that protects the otherwise highly immunogenic spermatogenic cells and sperm from immunological attack. At the same time, secretions of the testis, including androgens, influence the development and mature functions of the immune system. Activation of the immune system has negative effects on both androgen and sperm production, so that systemic or local infection and inflammation compromise male fertility. The mechanisms underlying these interactions have begun to receive the attention from reproductive biologists and immunologists that they deserve, but many crucial details remain to be uncovered. A complete picture of male reproductive tract function and its response to toxic agents is contingent upon continued exploration of these interactions and the mechanisms involved.",2010-12-31,"Hedger, M.P.",Comprehensive Toxicology,,,True,custom_license

It also has close links with hundreds of upstream and downstream industries in an economy. While the house-building industries in North America and Western Europe are relatively mature, those found in many parts of the Asia-Pacific region are still under development. Despite their short average history, the house-building industries in the region are growing fast and have been the engines for economic development in the region. This overview of the house-building industries in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, China, Thailand, and Malaysia focuses on important differences in the maturity and pace of development across jurisdictions. Fast economic growth in the less developed countries has offered opportunities for intensive development in the industry.

Carbohydrates are prominently displayed on the surface of cell membranes and expressed by virtually all secretory proteins in bodily fluids. This is achieved by the events of posttranslational protein modification called glycosylation. Importantly, expression of cellular glycans, in the form of either glycoproteins or glycolipids, is differentially regulated. Cell display of precise complex carbohydrates is characteristically associated with the stages or steps of embryonic development, cell differentiation, as well as transformation of normal cells to abnormally differentiated tumor or cancer cells. Sugar moieties are also abundantly expressed on the outer surfaces of the majority of viral, bacterial, protozoan, and fungal pathogens. Many sugar structures are pathogen specific, which makes them important molecular targets for pathogen recognition, diagnosis of infectious diseases, and vaccine development. Exploring the biological information content in carbohydrates is one of the current focuses of postgenomic research and technology development. Biophysical, biochemical, and immunological methods have proven very valuable in studying carbohydrate–carbohydrate and carbohydrate–protein interactions. Many well established immunochemical methods have been applied to determine the specificity and cross-reactivity of carbohydrate–antibody and carbohydrate–lectin interactions. A pressing need is, thus, the establishment of high-throughput technologies to enable the large-scale, multiplex analysis of carbohydrates and their cellular receptors. These include especially the characterization of immunological properties of carbohydrates that are important for medical applications of carbohydrate antigens and interactions of carbohydrates with other biomolecules or intact cells that play key roles in establishing comprehensive biological functions of essentially all existing living organisms.",2008-12-31,"Zhou, Xichun; Carroll, Gregory T.; Turchi, Craig; Wang, Denong","Carbohydrate Chemistry, Biology and Medical Applications",,,True,custom_license

It is possible to genetically manipulate most of the different classes of known viruses in order to produce recombinant viruses that express foreign proteins. Recombinant viruses have been used in gene therapy to deliver selected genes into higher organisms, in vaccinology and immunotherapy, and as important research tools to study the structure and function of these proteins. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are multiprotein structures that mimic the organization and conformation of authentic native viruses but lack the viral genome. They have been applied not only as prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines but also as vehicles in drug and gene delivery and, more recently, as tools in nanobiotechnology. In this article, basic and advanced features of viruses and VLPs are presented and their major applications are discussed. The different production platforms based on animal cell technology are explained, and their main challenges and future perspectives are explored. The implications of large-scale production of viruses and VLPs are discussed in the context of process control, monitorization, and optimization.

Proteases represent the largest segment of the industrial enzyme market where they are used in detergents, in food processing, in leather and fabric upgrading, as catalysts in organic synthesis, and as therapeutics. Microbial protease overproducing strains have been developed by conventional screening, mutation/selection strategies and genetic engineering, and wholly new enzymes, with altered specificity or stability have been designed through techniques such as site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Complete sequencing of the genomes of key Bacillus and Aspergillus workhorse extracellular enzyme producers and other species of interest has contributed to enhanced production yields of indigenous proteases as well as to production of heterologous proteases. With annual protease sales of about $1.5–1.8 billion, proteases account for 60% of the total enzyme market. Detergent proteases, with an annual market of about $1 billion account for the largest protease application segment. Subtilisin Carlsberg and related subtilisin serine proteases represent the first generation of detergent proteases with pH optima of 9–10. The second generation, having higher pH optima (10–11) and greater temperature stability, is produced from alkalophilic strains including Bacillus clausii and B. halodurans. The third generation consists of detergent proteases whose active sites and/or stability have been modified by protein engineering. The principal applications of proteases in food processing are in brewing, cereal mashing, and beer haze clarification, in the coagulation step in cheese making, in altering the viscoelastic properties of dough in baking and in production of protein hydrolysates. In organic synthesis, proteases have application in synthesis and/or hydrolysis of peptide, ester, and amide bonds involving carboxylic acids and are effective tools for resolution of pairs of enantiomers. Proteases have applications in nutrition as digestive aids and in therapy in thrombosis and cancer treatment. Hyperproteolytic endogenous activity may play significant roles in abnormal physiological functioning as well as in microbial and viral pathophysiological conditions and this has created substantial momentum for development of protease inhibitors as therapeutic agents against disease-causing proteases.",2011-12-31,"Ward, O.P.",Comprehensive Biotechnology,,,True,custom_license

Focusing on improving health management of replacements will yield tremendous returns through decreased losses of animals with the greatest genetic potential on the dairy, decreased costs of medication, improved growth rates, improved feed efficiency and earlier entry into the milking herd. Health management begins before replacements are born with attention to the nutrition of lactating and dry cows, the vaccination of lactating and dry cows, control of length of the dry period and both control of the disease status of the dams and the cleanliness of the calving environment. Greater attention must be paid to animal and environmental biosecurity to prevent introduction of diseases into the herd and to digestive disorders such as diarrhea, internal parasites and appropriate vaccination programs for the calves. Health management of replacements is often overlooked because producers do not see the immediate returns for their efforts. Common sense management in cattle, historical facts, experience based practice cultural and social aspects, combined with research, would depict that having adequately optimised balanced diets for the replacements, without producing excessive body conditions, could achieve a production of healthy replacements with superior levels of milk production.

Assisted reproductive technologies such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer have also been introduced and implemented in buffalo production with less success due to difficulty in detecting estrus. Providing good feed and feeding remain a challenge in buffalo husbandry due to limited feed resources. With improved management and proper breeding, the milk production from buffaloes has increased from 1500 to 5000l per lactation.

This species includes two types: (1) the river type, with 50 chromosomes, with an adult male weighing between 450 and 1000kg and with an annual milk production of 1000–3000kg; and (2) the swamp type, with 48 chromosomes, with an adult male weighing between 325 and 450kg and with an annual milk production of up to 600kg. The river buffalo is reared mainly for milk, whereas the swamp buffalo is reared mainly for draught. Only 3% of the world buffalo population is reared in the Mediterranean region. Significant numbers of buffaloes are at present found only in Italy, Romania, Egypt, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iraq and Iran. In all these countries, buffaloes represent only a very small portion of total livestock, except in Egypt, where buffaloes are more numerous than cattle. Because of the strong market demand for buffalo cheese, the number of buffaloes has increased in Italy and there is a preference for buffalo dairy products compared to cows' milk products in a few countries. Major morphological differences between the buffalo populations of different countries include (1) the variable size, ranging between a minimum of 280 and 300kg liveweight for adult females and males, respectively, in Egypt to a maximum of 900 and 1000kg in Iraq, the most frequent weights being 600 and 800kg; (2) the shape of the horns; and (3) the coat color, from dark gray and dark brown to black, showing white spots in some cases.",2016-12-31,"Borghese, A.; Moioli, B.",Reference Module in Food Science,,,True,custom_license

Use of medical devices with antimicrobial functions has been considered as a major avenue to fight against microbial infections. In addition, suitable packaging can slow the deterioration rate, and hence, extend the shelf-life of food.

New viruses and devastating communicable diseases such as Ebola and Zika are emerging; diseases previously considered eradicated such as measles are reemerging, while antibiotic resistance is increasing to dangerously high levels worldwide. Increased human population and accelerated global travel make local outbreaks instant global threats. Researchers are concerned that an avian influenza outbreak could kill many more people when it emerges because of the absence of immunity and human travel interaction patterns. Yet the threat of communicable disease varies by geographic location—where you live matters. This entry examines the spatial patterns of familiar communicable diseases, including the syndemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis, as well as new diseases such as Ebola, Zika, and dengue. It highlights the huge potential of mapping communicable disease genotypes while raising the alarm on the urgent need for effective global disease surveillance systems and new tools for fighting communicable diseases.

The discovery of vaccines, coupled with improved sanitation, hygiene, and health care, witnessed the eradication of several infectious diseases, although some have resurfaced or are resurfacing since the latter part of the 20th Century. While geography partly define hotspots for emerging and infectious diseases, low socioeconomic development, poverty, and underfunded health care systems remain driving forces for the reoccurrence of these diseases among vulnerable populations who experience material deprivation. To eradicate infectious diseases, a global response will have to prioritize the allocation of resources by way of expertise and technology to areas that are most affected.

FeLV is quite similar to the better-studied murine leukemia viruses in structure and genetic map. The virus particles bud from cytoplasmic membranes into either extracellular spaces or into vacuoles. FeLV has long been considered a typical noncytopathogenic, longlatency leukemia virus based on its behavior in fibroblasts in vitro. Recent evidence suggests that its in vivo behavior in critical target hemolymphatic tissues is as likely to be cytopathic as transforming. The type of FeLV-related disease that occurs and the disease-free interval probably are influenced by viral envelope proteins and glycoproteins and the consequences of proviral integration. FeLV subgroup specificity apparently determines when and what type of disease will occur. The ecotropic FeLV-A is the most frequent subgroup found in pet cats and is transmitted contagiously. Immunosuppression is the most frequent and the most devastating manifestation of FeLV viremia in clinical and experimental studies. It seems that multiple cell types and multiple processes are involved in the development of feline retrovirus-induced immunosuppression. Although no solid evidence is available for the malfunctioning of cat T helper cells because of the paucity of T-cell specific markers, the circumstantial evidence provided thus far indicates an impaired T helper function in FeLV-infected cats similar to that observed in humans infected with HIV. Studies on the pathogenesis of FeLV-induced immunosuppression might provide a valuable mode for a better understanding and means of control of human AIDS.",1988-12-31,"ROJKO, JENNIFER; ESSEX, MYRON; TRAININ, ZE'EV",Advances in Veterinary Science and Comparative Medicine,,,True,custom_license

As a source of toxin, it is rendered nontoxic by incubation with formalin under alkaline conditions. The product's retention of antigenicity, enabling it to induce antitoxin antibodies, makes it an excellent pediatric vaccine. Vaccine against Rinderpest Virus was developed by Koch in 1897 by administering bile from infected cattle. Animals that survived were permanently immune. Formalin- and chloroform-inactivated vaccines were developed using tissues from the infected animals. For the control of Newcastle disease, a number of attenuated live-virus vaccines have been developed which are widely used to control the disease. The Bl strain, the LaSota strain, and the F strain are used to immunize birds of all ages by different routes, including by addition to drinking water and by spraying. Protection against rabies correlates with SN antibody, which can be assessed by a number of tests.

The chapter focuses on the detection, diagnosis, risk assessment, and decision-making regarding viral infections. Several infections caused by DNA viruses are parvoviruses, rat cytomegalovirus, poxviruses, adenovirus, and papovavirus. Several RNA viruses and infections caused by these viruses are coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, rotavirus and reovirus, and picornaviruses. Monitoring for viral infections should cover at least three venues: animals in established breeding and experimental colonies, animals held in entry quarantine, and animal tissues and products destined for in vivo use. For established colonies, monitoring should be tailored to local conditions. Effective monitoring should encompass sampling on a pre-arranged schedule, which can be intensified if evidence or suspicion of viral infection emerges. Because viral infections of rats can spread insidiously, early detection and epidemiologic “staging” should employ a detection matrix that includes clinical observation, appropriate sampling, and sensitive and specific diagnostic testing.",2006-12-31,"Jacoby, Robert O.; Gaertner, Diane J.",The Laboratory Rat,,,True,custom_license

Due to the fact that a comprehensive colony health monitoring program is so vital in protecting the validity and reproducibility of experimental research data, it must be devoted an appropriate priority in terms of budget, personnel, and other resources. The policies and practices should be defined in written plans, and agreement with the principles set forth should be secured by the scientific and administrative leadership of the institution, as well as by the veterinary and animal care group. Programs should be designed to monitor individual animal health through the use of direct methods such as close observation and physical examination. A program created to monitor the overall health status of a colony population often utilizes more indirect methods. Routine testing of selected representative animals (even in the absence of any signs of illness or disease) can provide valuable information regarding the viral, parasitic, and bacterial agents that such animals are either currently harboring or have been exposed to in the past. Risk analysis should be done by any institution planning on holding rodents, a process that should involve a discussion of the relative costs and benefits of the various options available for routine health monitoring as well as quarantine isolation and testing.",2006-12-31,"Otto, Glen; Franklin, Craig L.",The Laboratory Rat,,,True,custom_license

CD13 is expressed by granulocytes and monocytes and their precursors. CD13 is a marker for most acute myeloid leukaemias and a smaller proportion of acute lymphoid leukaemias. Various nonhematopoietic cells express CD13, including epithelial cells from renal proximal tubules and intestinal brush border, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, brain cells, bone marrow stromal cells, osteoclasts, and cells lining the biliary caniculae. CD13 is a member of a group of type II integral membrane metalloproteases that includes the leucocyte antigens CD10, CD26, CD73, and BP-1. The CD13 glycoprotein has a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region that functions as a signal peptide, and a large C-terminal extracellular region that contains 11 N-linked glycosylation sites and also O-linked glycosylation. CD13 is a receptor for coronaviruses, RNA viruses that cause respiratory diseases in humans and several species of animals. The binding site on CD 13 for the swine coronavirus TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) is distinct from the enzymatic site. CD13 is a zinc-binding metalloprotease that plays a role in cell surface antigen presentation by trimming the N-terminal amino acids from MHC Class II-bound peptides.",1997-12-31,"Barclay, A.

It is estimated that the prevalence of wheezing during the first five years of life varies from 30–60%. In the majority of children who experience wheezing with respiratory infections, these episodes of wheezing become less frequent as the child grows older. However, determining whether the initial episode of wheezing with a viral respiratory illness is an important factor in the eventual development of asthma is an important question. Although a significant body of information suggests an association between respiratory tract illnesses in early life and the later development of airway dysfunction, this relationship is difficult to establish and indicates the complexity of factors that surround the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eventual expression of asthma. A similarly important issue to resolve is the relationship between respiratory infections and the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness. It is apparent that viral, not bacterial, upper respiratory infections (URIs) trigger asthma attacks. With the use of more sensitive techniques to identify respiratory viruses, the relationship between respiratory infections, particularly viral URIs, and asthma has become even more convincing and important.",1998-12-31,"Busse, William W.; Dick, Elliot C.; Lemanske, Robert F.; Gern, James E.",Asthma,,,True,custom_license

This chapter reviews the epidemiological evidence that implicates infectious pathogens as triggers. The chapter also discusses the mechanisms of interaction between the host-pathogen response and preexisting airway pathology resulting in an exacerbation. Much of the treatment of infective exacerbations for both asthma and COPD is symptomatic, consisting of bronchodilators or supportive in the form of oxygen, and in severe cases it includes noninvasive or invasive ventilatory measures. The current therapy for virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD relies on increased treatment of preexisting disease. Antibiotics are indicated for bacterial infections. The effective use of antiviral agents, particularly for influenza viruses, requires viral diagnosis, commencement of treatment early in the course of an exacerbation, or the targeting of high-risk groups for prophylaxis. Alternative strategies for drug development involve the identification of key factors common to exacerbations induced by a range of different viruses. Increased knowledge of the host–virus interaction can help in designing treatments that can increase virus clearance and minimize immunopathology.",2002-12-31,"Message, Simon D.; Johnston, Sebastian L.",Asthma and COPD,,,True,custom_license

The relationship between respiratory tract infection, especially viral infection, and exacerbations of airway diseases is very well established. However, research is required to find new ways to distinguish between the colonization and infective exacerbations of COPD to gain a better understanding of the role of infection in the disease. With advances in molecular biology, the antigenic structures of bacteria and the evaluation of the antibody response to antigens can become the basis for identifying an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECB). Most clinical trials of antibiotics were performed for licensing, and patients with pathogens resistant to different antimicrobials were excluded. Future studies of new antimicrobials should examine clinical efficacy more stringently based on a classification system that would help select patients most likely to benefit from an antibiotic. These studies should also include well-defined prospective economic analyses and quality-of-life assessment to ascertain the cost utility of the antibiotic in question.",2002-12-31,"Sharma, Sat; Anthonisen, Nicholas",Asthma and COPD,,,True,custom_license

COPD exacerbations are an important cause of the significant morbidity and mortality related to COPD. These COPD exacerbations increase with severity of the disease, and frequent exacerbations impact the patient's quality of life and activities of daily living. These exacerbations are also associated with considerable physiological deterioration and increased airway inflammatory changes caused by a variety of factors such as viruses, bacteria, and some common pollutants. Exacerbation of COPD results in an increase in airflow obstruction, which further increases the load on the respiratory muscles and increases the effort in breathing, thereby leading to respiratory failure in severe cases. Treatment approaches include the use of corticosteroids, antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilator therapy in certain cases, and ventilatory support. Increased patient education about detecting and treating exacerbations early in the natural history of COPD can be significantly beneficial.

The early history of mAAP relates to its role as Cys-Gly dipeptidase or cysteinyl-glycinase. It was proposed that this peptidase activity present in apparently purified RNA preparations contributed to polypeptide biosynthesis by acting in reverse in a sequential fashion. mAAP has a broad substrate specificity removing N-terminal amino acids (Xaa-Xbb-) from almost all unsubstituted oligopeptides and from an amide or arylamide. mAAP is a type II integral membrane protein located on the plasma membrane as an ectoenzyme. The pI is approximately 5. mAAP is widely distributed among species and tissues although it is of greatest abundance in brush border membranes of the kidney, in the mucosal cells of the small intestine and in the liver. It is also present in the lung where it is identical to the pI46 type II alveolar epithelial cell antigen and is located on endothelial cells in blood vessels. On polarized epithelial cells, mAAP is localized to the apical domain and is targeted there through an apical sorting signal thought to be located in the catalytic head group region of the protein.",2004-12-31,"Turner, Anthony J.",Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes,,,True,custom_license

Despite this success, major obstacles remain in developing vaccines for pathogens against which vaccines do not exist or against emerging pathogens and improving suboptimal vaccines. Key elements needed to design effective vaccines include identification of protective antigens against which a robust and durable adaptive response must be generated, compounds that can stimulate the innate immune responses, and optimal delivery systems which carry and dispense the antigenic and immuno stimulatory cargo to the appropriate cells of the immune system. The mechanistic understanding and the tools to manipulate this system are growing and it is likely that novel immune potentiators and delivery systems can make a significant impact on vaccine development in the near future. Thus, selecting the optimal platforms for development and identifying the key cellular and molecular targets of the innate immune system can trigger the safest and most effective immune responses against diverse pathogens which should be the long-term goal.",2006-12-31,"Pashine, Achal; Ulmer, Jeffrey B.; Valiante, Nicholas M.",Immunopotentiators in Modern Vaccines,,,True,custom_license

It is about explaining the importance of work to grant panels, funding agencies, and project reviewers; publishing research; and informing and educating the public. It is also involved in building relationships, bringing and keeping teams together, and becoming recognized. This chapter highlights the essentials of communication. The ability to communicate effectively is not an innate quality that one either does or does not possess. It is a set of skills that can be learned and developed, regardless of one's starting point. While some people seem more naturally adept than others, through conscious effort, practice, and constructive feedback, everyone can improve. Being able to speak knowledgeably and fluently is important for effective communication, especially at the beginning of any conversation or presentation because it sets the tone, and can positively influence self-confidence. An important strategy for increasing preparedness and effectiveness as a communicator is to commit to the continual development of skills. Another way to influence how to communicate successfully is to understand the audience—the “receivers” of the message—and to use the information to make the best “connection.”",2006-12-31,"Szymanski, Christine",Success Strategies for Women in Science,,,True,custom_license

Significant systemic constraints make hospitals reluctant partners in preparedness and generate ineffective responses. Such a condition has been highlighted by the antiterrorism training and preparedness programs over the past few years. The results of numerous such exercises and actual responses across the United States indicate a list of pitfalls—such as communications, hospital security, and hospital staff management—which are related to the inherent system limitations that hinder the effective disaster operations in hospitals. Hospitals are required to have and exercise emergency-preparedness plans. An all-hazard approach can allow for preparedness and a measured, flexible response to a variety of potential incidents.

After overcoming the onslaught of SARS, the Hong Kong community has become aware that emerging infections can occur at any time. This is reinforced by the recent avian influenza outbreaks, which act as a reminder of this looming threat. Hospitals have to evaluate their levels of preparedness against bioterrorism, which can simulate infectious disease outbreaks. The priority areas for improvement include community involvement, staff education, improved information technology, disease surveillance, and additional equipment and staff.

Virus structure, lifestyle, replication strategies, classication, the varied modes of transmission, infection, and disease manifestations are focussed upon in the chapter. Viruses are extremely simple “life” forms without metabolic capacity, organelles, translational machinery, or autonomous replicative potential; the essential elements of a virus are consequently minimal. A virus enters the host through any opportunistic opening of the body—; such as minute breaks in the skin barrier or mucosal linings of the eye, nose, etc. Antibodies produced during an infection often have the ability to bind the virus and reduce infectivity. An immediate question to solve during a virus outbreak is the mechanism by which the virus spreads. Viruses frequently infect animal or insect vectors that serve to pass the virus to humans. By identifying the virus through sequence analysis, a hypothetical reservoir can be predicted by the placement of the sequence on the phylogenetic tree‥ The varied modes of transmission, infection, and disease manifestations as they relate to the different diagnostic methods for virus identification are highlighted. Examples of naturally emerging viruses; such as Sin Nombre, Nipah, West Nile conclude the chapter. New technologies that allow the creation of manmade or “engineered” viruses, new frontiers in viral diagnostics, and a few thoughts on the future of virology are also presented. The global eradication of smallpox ranks as one of humankind's greatest accomplishments yet many viral challenges remain. HIV, hepatitis B and C, influenza, dengue, rotavirus, and many other viral diseases continue to affect tens of millions.",2005-12-31,"HIETPAS, JACK; MCMULLAN, LAURA K.; HANSON, HOLLY L.; RICE, CHARLES M.; MINDELL, DAVID P.",Microbial Forensics,,,True,custom_license

It reflects that diseases are not randomly distributed in the population and that individuals have certain characteristics that predispose to, or protect against, a variety of different diseases. Disease is the result of an epidemiological triad, where disease results from the interaction of: the human host, an infectious agent or toxin, and the environment that promotes the exposure. This chapter focuses on the use of epidemiology to identify the source of diseases caused by microorganisms or toxins. Microorganisms are very efficient at infecting humans, using a number of different strategies and mechanisms. The deliberate dissemination of a biological agent by many of these mechanisms presents the latest challenge to public health. It requires a careful epidemiologic investigation to determine whether an outbreak of infectious disease is because of the intentional release of an agent, or is naturally occurring.

Microbial forensics aims at identifying: the biological agent, its source, and the individuals responsible for a biothreat event. Analytic approaches differ when the suspected biothreat agent is encountered in a container or the environment, as opposed to a human or an animal. However, once the microbe or its toxin is in the living host, all the preceding items except the microbial nucleic acid cannot be analyzed. Nevertheless, the host response to the biological agent is available for analysis. The host response to a foreign substance is often a well orchestrated series of events designed to protect the individual from any harm. Modern techniques help to elucidate the pathways and components of the host response. Similar to a live microbe, vaccines can also provoke an antibody response. A vaccine can compose of: a live or attenuated microbe, a whole nonproliferating microbe, or an antigenic part of the microbe. Regardless, the intent of the vaccine is to produce protection, often by protective antibodies.

This chapter describes a practical procedure for electrofusion to produce hybrid cells between pluripotential stem cells and committed somatic cells without the use of virus or chemicals to mediate the fusion. One is required to culture exponentially growing ES cells on the inactivated PEFs with changes of culture medium once or twice a day. Carry out subculturing of the ES cells every 2 days by a 1:4 split. Trypsinize ES cells and remove excess trypsin quickly. Add 3 ml of ES medium to inactivate the trypsin and dissociate the cells into a single-cell suspension by gentle pipetting. Plate them on a new gelatin-coated 60-mm culture dish. Use the automatic operation switch to initiate AC followed by DC.

Monensin blocks the transport of secretory and membrane glycoproteins at the level of the Golgi complex, which appears dilated as an effect of the drug. Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein continues to be transported to the surface of monensin-treated cells, is cleaved into HA1 and HA2 and is incorporated into budding influenza virus particles. On the other hand, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein appears to accumulate in the membranes of the dilated Golgi apparatus of monensin-treated cells. This chapter discusses the effects of monensin on the kinetics of transport of viral membrane glycoproteins to the cell surface.

Particular attention is paid to the generation and use of complementation cell lines that carry the El genes and emphasizes on the PER.C6 cell line, which was developed to prevent generation of replication-competent adenovirus (RCA) during propagation of El-deleted adenoviral vectors. Further, safety issues with respect to the use of the cell line for making clinical grade material are also addressed in this chapter. The PER.C6 cell line is the best substrate for the production of adenoviral vectors for gene therapy or vaccines.

The properties and behavior of these vectors in heterologous situations are also discussed. Ideally, vectors for gene transfer into human cells should be capable of transgene expression without replication or detrimental expression of viral genes. Infection of human cell lines with intact xenogenic adenoviruses established the principle that these viruses are replication defective at the inputs tested, although the molecular basis for defective replication is not understood. Most work with xenogenic vectors is still firmly based in the laboratory and while this is appropriate to demonstrate the utility of a vector the amount of work required for eventual exploitation of a vector in the clinic should not be underestimated.

Large proportions are the result of virus infections. A commonly cited example of resurgent or recurrent disease is the yearly appearance of new antigenically different influenza viruses. These new variants are able to evoke disease in their host while causing the centuries-old symptoms of influenza. However, conventional virological techniques have failed to identify the agent, even though evidence suggested non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) is caused by a blood-borne, small enveloped virus, readily transmissible to chimpanzees. Modern molecular biology techniques are used to identify completely new viruses. These viruses can be associated with a new disease or associated with a well-characterized disease present in humans for many years. In identifying an emerging virus, one is often presented with epidemiological data and clinical specimens that have no reactivity with diagnostic reagents available for known pathogens. The primary aim therefore is to identify any new infectious agent and build a body of data to support the existence of a causal link between organism and disease.",1999-12-31,"Kellam, Paul",HIV and the New Viruses,,,True,custom_license

Antigens found on cell surfaces comprise not only those encoded by the cell itself but also the products of intracellular parasites. Soluble ligands may be bound to receptor structures on the cell membrane or lectin-like molecules bound to cell-surface carbohydrate structures. The molecules that form an integral part of the cell surface may be proteins, glycoproteins, or glycolipids. They subserve one of three major functions: adhesion, antigen recognition, or receptors for soluble mediators. However, many cell-surface molecules possess more than one function—for example, molecules involved in cell–cell or cell–extracellular matrix adhesion can also themselves be involved in signal transduction.

RNA recombination can occur in a spontaneous manner, and such a potential, even at low frequency, would expand opportunities for RNA conjunction.

In molecular evolution one of the remarkable observations has been the uniformity of the molecular clock. An analysis of proteins derived from complete potyvirus genomes, positive-stranded RNA viruses, yielded highly significant linear relationships. These analyses indicate that viral protein diversification is essentially a smooth process, the major parameter being the nature of the protein more than the ecological niche it finds itself in. Synonymous changes are invariably more frequent than nonsynonymous changes. Positive selection exploits a small proportion of genetic variants, while functional sequence space is sufficiently dense, allowing viable solutions to be found. Although evolution has connotations of change, what has always counted is natural selection or adaptation.

It has been realized that the cellular receptor guiding a virus to a target cell cannot be the sole determinant of a virus's pathogenic potential. Comparative analyses of the structures of genomes and their products have placed the picornaviruses into a large “picorna-like” virus family, in which they occupy a prominent place. Most human picornavirus infections are self-limiting, yet the enormously high rate of picornavirus infections in the human population can lead to a significant incidence of disease complications that may be permanently debilitating or even fatal. Picornaviruses employ one of the simplest imaginable genetic systems: they consist of single-stranded RNA that encodes only a single multidomain polypeptide, the polyprotein. The RNA is packaged into a small, rigid, naked, and icosahedral virion whose proteins are unmodified except for a myristate at the N-termini of VP4. The RNA itself does not contain modified bases. The key to ultimately understanding picornaviruses may be to rationalize the huge amount of information about these viruses from the perspective of evolution. It is possible that the replicative apparatus of picornaviruses originated in the precellular world and was subsequently refined in the course of thousands of generations in a slowly evolving environment. Picornaviruses cultivated the art of adaptation, which has allowed them to “jump” into new niches offered in the biological world.",1999-12-31,"Gromeier, Matthias; Wimmer, Eckard; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.",Origin and Evolution of Viruses,,,True,custom_license

The enzymatic breakdown of kinins affects the duration of their biological actions as the plasma half-life of intravenously injected BK is in the range of seconds. Kinins are cleaved in vitro and in vivo by enzymes that belong to families, such as zinc-metallopeptidases, astacin-like metallopeptidases, and catheptic enzymes. Vane noted the importance of the pulmonary circulation in the metabolism of vasoactive substances, such as BK as well as angiotensin 1 and 5- hydroxytryptamine. It is clear after decades of research that angiotensin 1-converting enzyme (ACE) on the vascular endothelial cell surface is the most important inactivator of blood-borne BK. BK may act primarily in an autocrine and paracrine fashion, establishing the importance of local regulation of its activity by enzymes on cell surfaces. Thus, the assortment of other enzymes that can inactivate BK is important in a variety of physiological and pathological situations. Most physiological systems have redundant pathways of metabolism so that the abolishment of one pathway is compensated for by the presence of others. This is demonstrated by the pharmacological inhibition of ACE in hypertension.",1997-12-31,"Erdös, Ervin G.; Skidgel, Randal A.",The Kinin System,,,True,custom_license

From the operational point of view, viruses are divided into those that affect vertebrate animals, insects, plants, and bacteria. The chapter discusses the viruses of vertebrate animals, although some of these viruses, the arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), also replicate in insects or other arthropods. Several hundred species of viruses have been recovered from humans, who are the best-studied vertebrate hosts and new ones are still occasionally discovered. Somewhat fewer have been recovered from each of the common species of farm and companion animals and from the commonly used laboratory animals. To simplify the study of this vast number of infectious agents, these are sorted into groups that share certain common properties. The most important criteria for classification are the physical and chemical characteristics of the virion and the mode of replication of the virus. The chapter explains a formal viral taxonomy, which is based on these criteria.",1987-12-31,"FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

Within a susceptible host species, there is often a striking difference between individual animals in their levels of resistance. Within susceptible species, resistance varies not only with the genetic constitution of the host but also with age, nutritional status, stress, and many other factors. These genetic and physiological factors determine what is called the nonspecific or innate resistance of the host, in contrast to the immunologically specific resistance that results from the operation of the immune response. Genetic differences in susceptibility are most obvious when different animal species are compared. Common viral infections often tend to be less pathogenic in their natural host species than in certain exotic or introduced species. Immunological responsiveness to particular antigens differs greatly from one strain of mouse to another, being under the control of specific immune response (Ir) genes. There are many of these genes, most of them situated in the region known as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).",1987-12-31,"FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

It presents examples illustrating the pathogenesis of four basic kinds of acute viral infection: respiratory, intestinal, generalized, and neurological. As the immune system plays a key role in protection against infections, viral damage to its components can exacerbate the severity of disease or predispose to superinfection with other viral or nonviral agents. Both specific acquired immunodeficiency and generalized immunosuppression can occur in viral infections. The immune response to viral infection may itself frequently contribute to the pathology of the disease. Inflammation with accompanying cellular infiltration is a regular feature of viral infection. Such common signs as erythema, edema, and enlargement of lymph nodes have an immunological basis. There are viral diseases in which the cardinal manifestations are caused by the body's immune response. Immunopathological (hypersensitivity) reactions are traditionally classified into types 1, 2, 3, and 4. For most viral infections, it is not known whether immunopathological effects make a significant contribution to disease and if so then as to which of the four classical hypersensitivity reactions is implicated. It is instructive to speculate about the possible involvement of different kinds of hypersensitivity reactions in viral diseases.",1987-12-31,"FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

In humans, coronaviruses are one of several groups of viruses that cause the common cold. The prototype of the family, avian infectious brochitis virus, is one of the most infectious of all viruses and causes an acute respiratory disease, which in young chicks can cause very high mortality. Outbreaks can be explosive, involving nearly every bird in the flock at about the same time, because of respiratory transmission and a very short incubation period. In many ways, transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine and mouse hepatitis virus behave similarly, affecting young animals most severely, spreading very quickly to all animals at risk, and causing major economic losses before control strategies can be put into place. The strategy of expression of the coronavirus genome is unique. The input virion RNA molecule is translated directly, one of the products being an RNA polymerase that then transcribes a full-length (—) sense copy RNA, from which in turn is transcribed a 3′-coterminal nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The nested set comprises six overlapping species of mRNAs that extend for different lengths from a common 3′ terminus. Only the unique sequence toward the 5′ end, which is not shared with the next smallest mRNA in the nested set, is translated, each product, therefore, being a unique protein.",1987-12-31,"FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

This listing is neither meant to substitute for a textbook of veterinary medicine or infectious diseases nor is it intended to be used for differential diagnosis, where viral and other etiologies must be considered together. Such a tabulation inevitably involves oversimplification, but page numbers have been provided to direct the reader to appropriate pages for detailed coverage of each of these viral infections. In these tables, each disease is ascribed to a measure of its importance as viewed from the perspective of veterinary medicine in countries with modern agricultural practices. There is an arbitrary element in relation to the group of diseases to which certain infections are allocated. For example, most generalized skin diseases result from generalized blood-borne infection but they have been listed as skin diseases. Where viruses cause generalized signs and also signs of particular importance in some system or in the newborn, they have been entered in both categories.",1987-12-31,"FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

All three infections may cause serious, debilitating, and sometimes fatal diarrheal disease in nursling and weanling mice. Mice of all ages can be infected by the EDIM virus but overt disease is restricted to animals up to about 12–13 days of age at the time of first exposure. The EDIM virus is worldwide in distribution. Its prevalence is difficult to estimate because serologic tests have not been readily available, and it is not customary to sacrifice animals for the purpose of examining the appearance of their intestinal tract or for electron microscopic visualization of fecal contents. The acute disease of reovirus 3 infection affects mainly sucklings and weanlings, whereas the chronic disease is encountered in animals over 28 days of age. The MHV virus, on the other hand, has been found to affect cotton rats, rats, and hamsters.",1982-12-31,"Kraft, Lisbeth M.",Diseases,,,True,custom_license

It also discusses other health hazards that may be encountered when working with mice, such as bites and allergies. Selected transmission of human infectious agents to mice is also briefly described in the chapter. Of the many latent viruses present in the mouse, only the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM) naturally infects man. A review of the literature attests to the ease with which the LCM can be transmitted from animals to man. Although its expression can vary greatly, the LCM virus infection appears most frequently as a mild influenza-like syndrome, with or without apparent involvement of the central nervous system. In one epidemic of the non-meningitic LCM virus infection caused by exposure to infected hamsters, an influenza-like illness was described with typical symptoms of retro-orbital headache, severe myalgia, malaise, anorexia, and aching pain in the chest. A variety of rodent hosts are included in the transmission cycle of the rickettsial disease in nature. The house mouse is the natural host of Rickettsia akari, which is the causative agent of rickettsialpox and a member of the spotted fever group of rickettsiae. Another rickettsial disease—murine typhus or endemic typhus—is transmitted to man by rat fleas; rats and mice are its natural reservoirs. Rickettsia mooseri—the causative agent—has not been isolated from natural infections in laboratory mice. Clinical signs, diagnosis, and control in man are similar to those described for rickettsialpox.",1982-12-31,"Fox, James G.; Brayton, James B.",Diseases,,,True,custom_license

There is evidence for the plausibility of psychosocial influences on infectious disease in humans as well as evidence for a role of stress in determining susceptibility for a small number of infectious agents. Little is known about the characteristics of psychosocial factors that increase or decrease risk of disease onset and progression and of the nature of behavioral, endocrine, and immune changes that are responsible for psychosocial-induced changes in disease risk. Until there is more empirical evidence for specific mechanisms linking psychosocial factors to infectious disease, there would be little real understanding of the extent to which evidence deriving from present work generalizes to other disease models. It is likely that the following years would result in an understanding of the relations between psychosocial factors and immunity, the mechanisms that link psychosocial influence to immune change, and the range of immune function that is subject to alteration.",1994-12-31,"Cohen, Sheldon",Handbook of Human Stress and Immunity,,,True,custom_license

Viruses held to a low number of passages in animals or cell cultures represent a viral population that is similar to that found in nature, and freezing these pools guards against genetic mutations that occur during subsequent passage. Aliquots of viral stocks frozen at a designated passage level can then be used for multiple and repeatable experiments with the same viral population. Furthermore, it is important that consistency should be maintained during the production of viral vaccines; new lots of final product are prepared with frozen viral seed stocks that consistently reproduce the desired immunogenic and attenuation characteristics. To better appreciate the requirements for freezing and freeze drying of human and animal viruses, some consideration is given to understanding the structural and functional organization of this diverse group of microorganisms. The classification of viruses is based on morphological and physiochemical properties. Thus, viruses are divided into those with DNA or RNA genomes and subdivided into families based on size and structural properties. Several methods for preservation of viruses are included in the chapter.",1996-12-31,"Beeler, Judy A.",Maintaining Cultures for Biotechnology and Industry,,,True,custom_license

Even though the widespread vaccination of domestic dogs has been the one most effective factor in the reduction of human rabies, the number of human deaths worldwide is greater than that of the combined deaths from polio, meningococcal meningitis, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenze (bird flu).Tools are available in highly efficacious and safe animal and human vaccines. Multiple factors can, however, prevent their use effectively in many areas of the world. For several decades, virtually all rabies nerve tissue origin (NTO) vaccines were inactivated with phenol using the method described by Semple. The NTO vaccines currently in use for mass vaccination campaigns in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean are primarily produced from rabies virus-infected suckling mouse brains or lamb brains. These vaccines are shown to be effective in campaigns. However, NTO-killed vaccines for dogs and other animals have often, in the past, resulted in post-vaccinal nervous system reactions that could result in the death of the vaccinated animals.",2007-12-31,"DREESEN, DAVID W.",Rabies,,,True,custom_license

Since the declaration of victory in the war against infectious diseases in 1967, approximately 50 new disease agents have been identified. Nearly every type of etiologic agent and clinical manifestation have been involved including acute respiratory infections (e.g., H5N1 influenza A, SARS, hantaviral cardiopulmonary syndrome, and Legionnaires’ disease), central nervous system involvement (e.g., West Nile encephalitis, Nipah virus encephalitis, and prion diseases), enteric infections (e.g., Helicobacter pylori gastric and duodenal diseases, cryptosporidiosis, microsporidioses, and Shiga toxin diseases), systemic bacterial diseases (e.g., Lyme disease, six new rickettsioses, three new human ehrlichioses, bartonelloses, and staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome), viral hemorrhagic fevers (e.g., Marburg, Ebola, Lassa, Bolivian, Argentine, and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fevers), human retroviral infections (e.g., HIV1 and 2 and HTLV-I and II), new human herpesviruses (HHV6, HHV7, and HHV8), and the viral agents of hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. There are the reciprocal threats that a bioterror agent (e.g., smallpox virus) could cause a newly emerging infectious disease (EID) and that an agent of emerging infections (e.g., SARS-coronavirus or Rift Valley fever virus) could be disseminated by terrorists. Vaccines offer a critically important potential countermeasure against the effects of these and future EIDs. An aggressive approach to developing prototype vaccines against each new class of etiologic agent must be driven by public health initiatives because commercial interests will not undertake these projects. The microbe must be completely characterized biologically, molecularly, and genetically. An accurate animal model of the human infectious disease should be developed. The mechanisms of vaccine-induced protective immunity must be elucidated and the antigens that stimulate these mechanisms of protective immune memory identified. Preclinical testing of vaccine candidates should then be completed in the animal models. It would be most effective if subunit vaccine platforms were developed in which new antigen cassettes could be inserted and FDA approval obtained using one or more prototypes. Experience in manufacturing and a track record of effectiveness and safety for vaccines against numerous emerging infectious agents could be achieved for veterinary diseases caused by organisms that also cause emerging human infections (e.g., West Nile virus and ehrlichioses). In the United States, these approaches are driven currently by individual investigator initiative in pursuing the scientific questions through grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Progress occurs, but not at the desired level. An emerging infection with high transmissibility (e.g., R o=10) and a case-fatality rate of 15% would cause global devastating effects at a level on the order of magnitude of a nuclear war. Our efforts to prepare for EIDs fall far short of nuclear attack preparedness during the Cold War.",2009-12-31,"Olano, Juan P.; Walker, David H.",Vaccines for Biodefense and Emerging and Neglected Diseases,,,True,custom_license

Our fundamental view of the nature of a vaccine was changed with the discovery of DNA immunization in the early 1990s when it was determined that the genetic material that encodes for antigens, rather than the actual antigens themselves, can be effective in eliciting an immune response. Given the ever increasing threat of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and a renewed concern regarding the use of biological agents for bioterrorism purposes, the opportunities that DNA vaccine technology provides could not have come at a more critical time in history. Since its inception, DNA vaccination technology has undergone significant advancements and many candidate human vaccine formulations have already been developed. Improved modes of administration, the use of codon and antigen gene optimization, and the implementation of vaccination DNA prime/boost regimens have led to the quick progression of DNA vaccines from research laboratory benches to human clinical trials. Significant progress has been made in developing DNA vaccines against various biodefense and emerging infectious disease targets, such as HIV-1, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola, the viral encephalitides, anthrax, plague, and botulism, among others with some already moving into early phase clinical trials with promising results.

A general overview of the history of the regulatory guidelines and ethical principles underpinning the vaccine development process is provided, with an emphasis on clinical trials conducted in the United States. The contemporary vaccine development process involves sequential assessment of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in phase1, 2, and 3 clinical trials. The process is not always linear or straightforward, and adaptive flexible clinical trial designs can increase the likelihood of a successful outcome. Because the efficacy of vaccines for a number of the diseases discussed in this volume cannot be tested directly in humans, alternative approaches have been developed to address this challenge. The major elements of typical clinical trial protocol are discussed, and a checklist of essential documents supporting the trial is provided.

Much of veterinary vaccinology is driven by the realities that exist in raising production animals or working in veterinary practice, where making a living depends on keeping the animals healthy, because it is an industry where vaccines are like insurance policies—protection from events that one hopes never happen. For example, the USDA recognizes these varying levels of protection in the way that they allow label claims: (1) “aids in disease control,” (2) “for the prevention of disease,” and (3) “for the prevention of infection.” Additionally there may be indirect protection, or herd immunity, that results from vaccination of sufficient numbers of animals in a given population resulting in the reduction of the ability of a disease to transmit through the vaccinated individuals. The perception that vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, where the disease agent does not establish an infection, while widely held, is generally unfounded and largely unrealistic. Recent advances, especially in the last 15 years in genomics, proteomics, biotechnology, immunology, pathogenesis, and vaccine formulation and delivery have dramatically changed our approach to vaccine development. When used optimally, vaccines have been shown to prevent disease, reduce the need for pharmaceutical intervention, and improve the health and welfare of animals, and indirectly people as well. The challenge in developing an optimal vaccination program is in dealing with the great diversity that exists within the animal world, and as such there probably is no single optimal program for all occasions. While there is no magic solution to optimizing vaccination programs for animals, nonetheless, a solid understanding of the animal’s innate and environmental risk factors as well as the variables such as stress will enable the development of tailored vaccination schedules that best meets the needs of the animal. The use of vaccines in animal health is not restricted to the protection of morbidity and mortality of the animal hosts themselves, but they are regularly employed as key elements in public health programs. When appropriate biopreparedness, management modeling strategies, and contingency plans of the future are linked with (1) protective DIVA vaccines against zoonoses, (2) effective predictive modeling, and (3) deployable implementation policies, control, and prevention of serious zoonotic diseases of man and animals will become more achievable at local, state, and national levels.",2009-12-31,"Adams, L.

Measles virus is a nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus and a member of the Morbillivirus genus in the family of Paramyxoviridae. Although RNA viruses have high mutation rates, measles virus is an antigenically monotypic virus and the surface proteins responsible for inducing protective immunity have retained their antigenic structure. The public health significance is that measles vaccines developed decades ago from a single measles virus strain remain protective worldwide. Prior to the development and widespread use of measles vaccine, 30 million cases of measles were estimated to occur each year, resulting in more than 1 million deaths. Several live, attenuated measles vaccines are available, either as single-antigen vaccines or in combination with rubella and mumps vaccines (MR and MMR vaccines). Most of the currently used measles vaccines were derived from the Edmonston strain of measles virus that was isolated by Enders and Peebles in 1954. Measles vaccines are recommended for all susceptible children and adults for whom the vaccine is not contraindicated. Despite progress in reducing measles mortality, measles remains a major cause of vaccine-preventable death and an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia. The ideal measles vaccine would be inexpensive, safe, heat-stable, immunogenic in neonates or very young infants, and administered as a single dose without needle or syringe. A number of vaccine candidates with some of these characteristics are undergoing preclinical studies, including DNA vaccines and various viral and bacterial vectored vaccines. The high infectivity of measles virus is a characteristic suitable to a biothreat agent. However, increasingly high levels of measles vaccination coverage throughout the world as part of accelerated measles control efforts would protect many from the deliberate use of measles virus as a biothreat agent. Genetic engineering of a measles virus strain that was not neutralized by antibodies induced by the current attenuated measles vaccines would likely have reduced infectivity, as suggested by the fact that wild-type measles viruses have not mutated to alter their neutralizing epitopes. Measles virus meets many of the biological criteria for disease eradication. Measles virus has no nonhuman reservoir, can be accurately diagnosed, and measles vaccination is a highly effective intervention. Where measles virus differs from smallpox and polio viruses is that it is more highly infectious, necessitating higher levels of population immunity to interrupt transmission. It remains unclear whether the threat from bioterrorism precludes stopping measles vaccination after eradication, but provision of a second opportunity for measles vaccination likely could be stopped following eradication.",2009-12-31,"Moss, William J.; Griffin, Diane E.; Feinstone, W.

Animals immunized with inactivated whole virus vaccines or live-recombinant vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV S protein (e.g., using rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, adenovirus, or attenuated vaccinia virus MVA as a vector), as well as mice immunized with DNA vaccines expressing the S protein gene all developed neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV and were protected against SARS-CoV challenge. Although much effort has been focused on developing a SARS vaccine, the commercial viability of such a vaccine for SARS-CoV will ultimately depend on whether the virus re-emerges in the near future. This vaccine should induce highly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies to protect against newly emerging viruses related to SARS-CoV and protect both the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract in the absence of significant side effects. Given the fact that in the previous outbreak mainly the elderly succumbed to the infection, special attention should be given to vaccines that are able to efficiently protect aged individuals.",2009-12-31,"Haagmans, Bart L.; Osterhaus, Albert D.M.E.",Vaccines for Biodefense and Emerging and Neglected Diseases,,,True,custom_license

Agricultural and industrial development has resulted in the increased density of humans living in close proximity to each other. This lifestyle change from more rural existence has brought humans in closer proximity to wild animals that harbor potential future human pathogens. Most diseases are transmitted by insect vectors. Molecular diagnostic tests can be divided into two primary groups. The first are tests designed to detect the presence of mutations in the human genome that are associated with specific diseases. These tests need to be performed only once in a specific individual’s lifetime. The second group of molecular diagnostic assays is designed to detect infectious agents or the recurrence of a mutation specifically associated with a tumor the patient has had in the past. Bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections can be eradicated and recur at a time in the future requiring repetition of the same molecular assay for detection. Minimal residual disease detection refers to the analysis of tissue/cells in a patient previously diagnosed with a malignancy to evaluate if therapy was completed successfully or if rare malignant cells are present.",2010-12-31,"Kiechle, Frederick L.",Molecular Diagnostics,,,True,custom_license

Respiratory infections are very common. They are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality and are costly in terms of lost time from work, inappropriate use of antibiotics, and lengthy hospital stays. Laboratory detection of causative agents can influence treatment and allow appropriate infection control measures, potentially saving time and money, promoting quicker recovery for the patient, and lowering the risk of nosocomial transmission of the organism. Molecular testing may be the most sensitive method of detecting respiratory viruses. These methods have been shown to detect multiple viruses in a single sample more often than any of the other methods described and, in addition, can detect viruses that are difficult or impossible to grow. The detection of nonviable organisms may provide additional insight into disease but provides its own challenges in terms of determining clinical significance of positive results. Like many areas of clinical medicine and microbiology, the increasing use of molecular diagnostics for detection of respiratory viruses raises many new questions for the laboratory and the clinical diagnostician, but also promises many benefits as these methods become increasingly available for routine use.",2010-12-31,"Carr, Jeanne; Williams, Donna G.; Hayden, Randall T.",Molecular Diagnostics,,,True,custom_license

Even this is complicated, as it is impossible to generalize with this virus, due to marked differences in the biologic behavior of the myriad virus strains, plus the marked effects of a large number of host factors. It is now known that the MHV group is represented by numerous variants that are constantly mutating, and that these viruses can be biologically separated into respiratory (polytropic) MHVs and enterotropic MHVs, with distinctly different patterns of tissue tropism. This dichotomy is emphasized for discussion, but biology is never absolute. Many of the early MHV isolations are made as a result of contamination of biological materials that correlated with their polytropic biologic behavior. Their stated tropisms frequently were the result of the investigators' research interests and many have therefore been subjected to selective passage that favors a particular tissue tropism. All MHV isolates are related genetically and antigenically, but isolates can be differentiated by genetic sequencing, cross-serum neutralization, or with monoclonal antibodies.

Although, probably not as frequent in laboratory mouse colonies as it used to be, LDV infection may affect experimental results, primarily through its effects on the host immune responses. On the other hand, because of its unique properties, LDV infections serve as a good animal model for viral persistence, virally induced immunomodulation, and pathogenic infection of neurons in the central nervous system. However, the inability of LDV to infect in transformed cell lines and to cause a detectable cytopathic effect in cell cultures in which it replicates, such as mouse peritoneal exudate cells, represents technical obstacles to the further analysis of this virus. Identification of the cell receptor utilized by LDV would constitute a major advance, since this might lead to the creation of a cell line permissive to LDV infection. Whereas LDV is a natural and sometimes pathogenic infectious agent of the mouse, it does not currently represent a major threat to animal facilities. The virus is not very contagious and there are a number of easy methods available to detect infected mice. Moreover, further study of the interaction between relatively silent viruses, such as LDV, and their host species should lead to new insights into the mechanisms by which viruses can establish and maintain relatively harmless, persistent infections in their hosts.",2007-12-31,"Coutelier, Jean-Paul; A.

The biomedical literature contains numerous reports of zoonotic diseases and parasitic infestations from laboratory mice and their wild counterparts. The extended maintenance of the laboratory mouse over a number of generations under controlled and increasingly sophisticated laboratory animal housing conditions with veterinary oversight and effective infection control measures has markedly reduced the likelihood that zoonotic agents would be encountered in a modem animal care and use environment. Wild caught mice that are maintained in naturalistic housing environments in the laboratory, laboratory mice that have contact with wild or feral mice, and mice kept as pets in the home environment are examples of animal management conditions that would be conducive to the expression and transmission of zoonotic diseases and other mouse-associated hazards. In addition to the zoonoses, mice are capable of inflicting bites on inadequately trained personnel and are a rich source of allergens for a substantial number of persons predisposed to develop mouse-associated allergic sensitivities. This chapter discusses the mouse-associated zoonotic diseases and other health hazards and explains the strategies that are helpful for reducing or eliminating the risk of personnel exposure to these conditions.",2007-12-31,"E.

The progression of these two events is partially driven by the increasing regulatory demands related to safety/toxicity assessment of novel drug development. The availability of inbred strains has led to major breakthroughs in cancer, biology, and immunology. In addition, outbred stocks continue to be utilized in a wide variety of studies but particularly in the fields of toxicology and pharmacology. The power of these models to elucidate the genetic basis of disease cannot be overemphasized. This provided complete nucleotide sequences for each genome allowing investigators to quickly develop the equivalent murine model for many of the inherited human diseases.

Comprehensive health care must be provided in all of these areas to be effective. An unwanted infectious agent that does not cause clinically evident signs could still have a major adverse impact on research results if allowed to disseminate. As a result, the program for providing health care must include detection and care of individual mice that are ill, routine colony surveillance to guard against the undetected entry and spread of previously excluded infectious agents, and a response plan if such agents are detected. Such programs result in humane care of animals and the best protection of experimental repeatability and validity. As infectious agents, detection and treatment methods, and the research environment evolve, the veterinary and husbandry staff caring for research animals must strive to keep themselves educated and informed.

This in turn has increased the need to thoroughly monitor the environment of mice and the equipment used for their care. Environmental and equipment monitoring are viewed as management tools used to control the quality of mice produced or housed in the facility. Their purpose is to help safeguard the health of the animals and personnel. In its distilled form, much of environmental and equipment monitoring is common sense coupled with a constant awareness that an animal care program is a dynamic organization dependent on the interaction of animals and people with the physical facility. If the animals are to remain healthy and the physical plant is to continue to function properly, there is little room for error. The errors arise neither from the animals nor the equipment but from the people who are responsible for developing a management policy and style that maintains the health of the animals and the integrity of the physical plant, yet at the same time makes it a pleasant and functional place for both mice and people to accomplish their intended tasks.",2007-12-31,"David Small, J.; Deitrich, Rick",The Mouse in Biomedical Research,,,True,custom_license

Natural killer (NK) cells develop in the bone marrow (BM) and are not static but populate secondary and primary lymphoid organs. A unique feature of NK cells is their expression of activating and inhibitory receptors, which allow them to respond either when ligands for activating receptors are upregulated or when ligands for inhibitory receptors are downregulated. The unique transcriptome of NK cells renders them capable of protecting the host from a vast array of disease states. Their undisputed importance in host protection is conferred by their ability to eliminate unhealthy cells. However, in order for NK cells to exert their effects, they need to be strategically located at the right places. This chapter provides an overview of the current understanding of the localization of NK cell populations and their ability to migrate in response to homeostatic and pathological conditions. NK cells develop in the BM, which they exit using specific molecular interactions. Exit from the BM is followed by localization to a number of tissues, including secondary lymphoid organs. Within each tissue, NK cells often acquire unique function and phenotype that is regulated by the local microenvironment. Their localization is primarily directed by the action of chemokines and therefore is in tight association with the activation status of the organism. Changes in chemokine expression during disease results in further NK cell mobilization and allows them to protect the host from infection and malignancy. Thus, from their time of production until their end, NK cells travel exhaustively over long distances and visit places that influence their already dynamic life.",2010-12-31,"Bekiaris, Vasileios; Lane, Peter J.L.",Natural Killer Cells,,,True,custom_license

NK cells develop from a common lymphoid precursor resident in the bone marrow (BM) that is considered the main site of their generation. The BM microenvironment provides a rich source of cytokines and growth factors and allows intimate contact between developing NK cells and stromal cells, which is required for their full maturation. Individual NK cell subsets displaying unique functional features, and tissue locations have been identified both in mouse and humans. Involvement of chemokines in the regulation of DC-mediated NK cell priming and effector functions has also been documented and should be taken into account when analyzing the role of chemokines in NK cell-dependent immune responses. Studies in man and mouse have shown that NK cells are distributed in several organs under normal conditions. Their frequency is comparatively high in nonlymphoid organs such as the lung, the liver and the mucosal tissue of maternal uterus, and rare in thymus and lymph nodes. Chemotactic factors, including chemokines, play critical roles in the regulation of NK cell migration across endothelium and into the tissues. The differences in chemokine receptor expression together with distinct adhesive properties of different NK cell subsets as well as activated NK cells, imply that they have multiple routes of circulation and trafficking patterns. Besides their role in the regulation of NK cell trafficking, chemotactic molecules can also affect NK cell effector functions by regulating their priming and their ability to kill and secrete cytokines.",2010-12-31,"Gismondi, Angela; Bernardini, Giovanni; Santoni, Angela",Natural Killer Cells,,,True,custom_license

Recently, there has been growing insight into the biological functions of NK cells, in particular into their roles in infection, tumorurveillance and autoimmunity. Under these pathophysiological circumstances, NK cells readily home to the central nervous system (CNS) tissues to combat infection and presumably to curb progression of tumor. Bystander neuronal and/or glial cell damage can occur in this setting. Paradoxically, NK cells appear to have an inhibitory role for autoimmune responses within the CNS. As in the periphery, NK cells act in concert with T cells and other lymphocytes responsible for CNS pathology and immune regulation. Insights into the molecular signals and pathways governing the diverse biological effects of NK cells are keys for designing NK cell-based therapy for CNS infections, tumor and autoimmune diseases.NK cells readily accumulate in homing to CNS tissues under the pathophysiological situations. This process is tightly controlled by a number of chemokines and chemokine receptors. There is ample of evidence that NK cells within the CNS contribute to the control of infections and might limit progression of certain tumor. Bystander neuronal and/or glial cell damage can occur. In certain autoimmune conditions of the CNS, NK cells appear to have an inhibitory role. Disassociation of disease-inhibiting versus disease-promoting effects of NK cells is a key to harnessing NK cells for therapeutic purposes. To achieve this goal, a generation of genetic models with selective NK cell deficiency, and development of reagents (antibodies) for visualizing subsets of NK cells in situ will be necessary.",2010-12-31,"Shi, Fu-Dong; Ransohoff, Richard M.",Natural Killer Cells,,,True,custom_license

The traveler can be the target and sufferer from microbial threats; the traveler can also provide the microbial transport system. Traveling humans alter infectious diseases patterns by introducing pathogenic microbes or resistance, or virulence factors into new populations. The movement of pathogenic microbes through history has been intimately linked to the capacity of humans to travel and to migrate to new locations. Today, humans have the capacity to reach virtually any city in the world within a day or two. Travel to tropical and developing countries are increasing more rapidly than travel to developed countries, and all projections suggest that human travel will continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Infectious diseases influence decisions about travel and trade; and travelers change the epidemiology of infectious diseases. Travel has played an essential role in the movement of HIV/AIDS throughout the world. Rapid international air travel moved the virus that causes SARS to multiple countries within weeks.

Smallpox was eradicated using a mass vaccination strategy. The major successes in controlling infectious diseases in the 1950s and 1960s was followed by two coincident global trends that would have an impact on the dramatic reemergence of infectious diseases in the waning years of the twentieth century. The first was the redirection of the resources that were once used to control infectious diseases to other public health priorities, such as the “War on Cancer” in the early 1970s. The perception that infectious diseases were no longer a problem led to decreased resources, widespread deterioration of public health infrastructure to deal with infectious diseases, and complacency among government and public health officials as well as the public. This trend included medical education with a deemphasis on preventive medicine and a strong focus on curative medicine in medical schools. The second trend was the sharply increasing and unprecedented rate of human population growth following World War II that has continued for 60 years. Increasing human numbers have been a principal factor leading to uncontrolled urbanization, changes in agriculture, land use and animal husbandry practices, and accelerated globalization, all of which have been major and interrelated drivers of the reemergence of epidemic infectious diseases.",2008-12-31,"Wilcox, Bruce A.; Gubler, Duane J.; Pizer, H.F.",The Social Ecology of Infectious Diseases,,,True,custom_license

A single donation of a pint of whole blood is virtually always separated by centrifugation into a unit of red blood cells and a unit of plasma; a unit of platelets or a unit of cryoprecipitated plasma can also be prepared, but this is done for less than half of whole blood donations, since patients' clinical needs for platelets and cryoprecipitated plasma are much less than patients' needs for red blood cell transfusion. Each of these units is labeled, and regulated as a drug, following FDA regulations. While today virtually all of these blood components from whole blood donation are from volunteer donors, the FDA would permit paying these donors, but requires that the component's label be marked conspicuously with the words “PAID DONOR” as opposed to “VOLUNTEER DONOR.” Whole blood donation is permitted no more often than once every eight weeks. Most of the plasma separated from red blood cell units is not needed for direct transfusion to patients, and so it is provided as “Recovered Plasma” to large multinational for-profit companies that pool and fractionate it into plasma derivatives.

There is historical precedent for the use of biological agents against both military and civilian populations. The use of biological (and chemical) agents as weapons of war has been well documented. The German biological warfare program during World War I included covert infections of Allied livestock with anthrax and glanders. The Japanese army began conducting experiments on the effects of bacterial agents of biowarfare on Chinese prisoners in occupied Manchuria in 1932 at their infamous Unit 731. The United States began its own offensive biological weapons program in 1942 and, during its 28-year official existence, weaponized and stockpiled lethal biological agents, such as anthrax, as well as incapacitating agents, such as the etiologic agent of Q fever. There are some recent examples of bioterrorism, though not necessarily resulting in attacks causing morbidity or mortality, may serve as harbingers of future events. Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq developed and deployed anthrax and botulinum-laden warheads in the years leading up to the Gulf War. The reasons that these weapons were never used in an actual attack probably had more to do with the implicit threat of overwhelming US retaliation and Iraqi technological deficiencies rather than the regime's reluctance to violate any moral principles. Biological agents have also been used to forward political ideologies: in 1984 a religious cult, intent on influencing voter turnout during a local election, contaminated restaurant salad bars in The Dalles, Oregon.",2008-12-31,"Artenstein, Andrew W.; Martin, Troy",The Social Ecology of Infectious Diseases,,,True,custom_license

Human ecology is undergoing rapid transition. This encompasses urbanization, rising consumerism, changes in working conditions, population aging, marked increases in mobility, changes in culture and behavior, evolving health-care technologies, and other factors. Global climate change is becoming a further, and major, large-scale influence on the pattern of infectious disease transmission. It is likely to become increasingly important over at least the next halfcentury, as the massive, highinertial, and somewhat unpredictable process of climate change continues. The many ways in which climate change does and will influence infectious diseases are subject to a plethora of modifying influences by other factors and processes: constitutional characteristics of hosts, vectors and pathogens; the prevailing ambient conditions; and coexistent changes in other social, economic, behavioral, and environmental factors. This global anthropogenic process, climate change, along with other unprecedented global environmental changes, is beginning to destabilize and weaken the planet's life-support systems. Infectious diseases, unlike other diseases, depend on the biology and behavior—each often climate-sensitive—of two or more parties.

As measured by indicators such as accountability, stability, rule of law, respect for human rights, and the existence of an independent civil society, plays a significant role in health outcomes—a role independent of, and perhaps even superior to, host genetics, insect vectors, or individual behaviors. Famines stem not solely from bad weather or genetics, but also from the failure of governments to protect their populations from civil strife, or to equitably distribute food aid. Despite the widespread acceptance of these findings, the influence of governance on infectious disease spread has received far less attention. Both governance and health can be measured in many different ways, and one factor complicating efforts to measure the association between the two is the difficulty finding accurate, sensitive, and specific enough indicators for either variable. Broad measures of population health—such as life expectancy, and infant and maternal mortality—have been chosen by a number of authors, in part because these indicators capture multiple specific diseases and are broadly distributed across the population.",2008-12-31,"Cohen, Jonathan; Amon, Joseph J.",The Social Ecology of Infectious Diseases,,,True,custom_license

CSF has four major functions: physical support of neural structures, excretion and “sink” action, intracerebral transport, and control of the chemical environment of the central nervous system. CSF provides a “water jacket” of physical support and buoyancy. The CSF is protective because its volume changes reciprocally with changes in the volume of intracranial contents, particularly blood. Thus, the CSF protects the brain from changes in arterial and central venous pressure associated with posture, respiration, and exertion. Acute or chronic pathological changes in intracranial contents can be accommodated, to a point, by changes in the CSF volume. The direct transfer of brain metabolites into the CSF provides excretory function. This capacity is important because the brain lacks a lymphatic system. The lymphatic function of the CSF is also manifested in the removal of large proteins and cells, such as bacteria or blood cells, by bulk CSF absorption. The “sink” action of the CSF arises from the restricted access of water-soluble substances to the CSF and the low concentration of these solutes in the CSF.",2008-12-31,"Vernau, William; Vernau, Karen A.; Sue Bailey, Cleta",Clinical Biochemistry of Domestic Animals,,,True,custom_license

The book defines the important microorganisms that are involved in environmental microbiology, the nature of the different possible environments in which they are situated, the methodologies used to monitor microorganisms and their activities, and the possible effects of microorganisms on human activities. The book addresses the new challenges of modern environmental microbiology, in which pathogens and bioremediation remain fundamental to the field. However, in both cases, the subject areas have been greatly enhanced through the application of molecular genetics and biotechnological tools. Another important area that has been included is that of molecular ecology, which involves investigating diversity in the environment and mining and exploiting that diversity for new natural products and activities.

This chapter describes the nature and modern treatment of waste water, land applications of waste water, and methods of land applications of biosolids and animal wastes. The amount of organic matter in domestic wastes determines the degree of required biological treatment. Various tests are used to assess the amount of organic matter: biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC). The complete sewage treatment comprises three major steps: primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment. Tertiary treatment processes involving physicochemical processes can be effective in reducing the concentration of pathogens. The treated domestic wastewater may be disposed of via land application for crop irrigation or as a means of additional treatment and disposal through the three basic methods that include low-rate irrigation, overland flow, and high-rate infiltration.",2009-12-31,"Gerba, Charles P.; Pepper, Ian L.",Environmental Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

While having the latest high-tech robotic patient simulators emplaced within fully functional clinical spaces is great, that alone does not provide enough realism. Naïve people are generally impressed by the mannequin and its capabilities, but the “patient” is the most artificial thing about simulation. It's more important to use the technology as a lens to focus on the human aspect of interactions. In the quest for realism, clinical educators create context by placing the mannequin in a simulated or real environment, breathe life into it with human interaction, and take advantage of the learner's imagination. To facilitate learners being more receptive to the educators, the Patient Simulation Center located at St. Michael's Hospital in downtown Toronto, Canada, always presents a supportive and nonthreatening atmosphere. It aims to provide experiential acquisition of skills and judgment, allowing lessons to be learned from errors made. Before starting, learners are familiarized to the environment and the mannequin, and provided with a set of ground rules. This is done on a need-to-know basis, being careful not to cognitively overload the learners with too many rules. There is no need to share all the capabilities and limitations of simulation or to explain how the props work. Keep it simple and user friendly.

Immunosensors incorporate the specific immunochemical reaction with the modern transducers including electrochemical (potentiometric, conductometric, capacitative, impedance, amperometric), optical (fluorescence, luminescence, refractive index), and microgravimetric transducers. These immunosensor devices with dramatic improvements in the sensitivity and selectivity possess the abilities to investigate the reaction dynamics of antibody–antigen binding and the potential to revolutionize conventional immunoassay techniques. With the rapid development of immunological reagents and detection equipments, immunosensors have allowed an increasing range of analytes to be identified and quantified and in particular, simple-to-use, inexpensive, and reliable immunosensing systems have been developed for areas such as outpatient monitoring, large screening programs, and remote environmental surveillance. Immunosensors with lowered detection limits and increased sensitivities have been developed in various fields, particularly in clinical analysis. A noticeable development trend is also observed in the development of immunosensors combining with other techniques such as flow injection analysis (FIA) or capillary electrophoretic (CE) analysis, which complement and improve the present immunoassay methods. Belov et al. have proposed a novel immunophenotyping method for leukemias which uses a cluster of differentiation antibody microarray, and a microarray of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been developed for autoimmune diagnosis of systematic rheumatic disease. Development of microfluidic immunosensor systems for proteomics and drug discovery have also been reported in recent years where the microfluidic system integrates multiple processes in a single device to improve analytical performance by reducing the reagent consumption and the analysis time, and increasing reliability and sensitivity through automation.",2008-12-31,"Wang, Hua; Shen, Guoli; Yu, Ruqin","Electrochemical Sensors, Biosensors and their Biomedical Applications",,,True,custom_license

Airborne transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to humans from the environment, animals, or other humans can result in disease. Inhalation is an important route of exposure as the lung is more susceptible to infection than the gastrointestinal tract. Ingested microorganisms must past through the acidic environment of the stomach before they can colonize tissue while inhaled microorganisms are deposited directly on the moist surfaces of the respiratory tract. Inhalation of microbial aerosols can elicit adverse human health effects including infection, allergic reaction, inflammation, and respiratory disease. Following inhalation, infectious viruses, bacteria, and fungi can establish in host cells of the respiratory tract. Some are translocated and infect the gastrointestinal tract and other tissues. This chapter discusses human viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases transmitted via aerosols. Viral diseases presented are influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) and hantavirus disease, measles, and varicella. Bacterial diseases are Legionnaires’ disease, tuberculosis, and nontubercule mycobacterial disease.

Comprehensive surveillance of morbidity and mortality for dozens of conditions has since been well established in the United States and in other industrialized countries. However, despite the clear need for epidemiological data to inform health policies, reliable and comprehensive health statistics are not available in many developing countries. International efforts to assess and monitor the burden of certain diseases have been limited in the past to a small number of infectious diseases in the context of global eradication programs – smallpox, poliomyelitis, guinea worm, and, more recently, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and avian flu influenza A (H5N1). The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), published in 1996, filled an important gap in our knowledge of population health status. It created a common metric, the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), to estimate morbidity and mortality for eight regions that collectively span the world’s population, generating comparable information on incidence and prevalence in global health. However, patterns of disease, disability, and risk factors have since changed significantly and new data on their distribution are available. Furthermore, the unprecedented money and attention now pouring into international health has made an accurate assessment of global health patterns a matter of utmost urgency. The new Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD 2005) project, which began in 2007, represents the first major effort at a systematic revision of estimates in health for every region in the world comprehensively, and will ensure that that the global health community bases its research and policies on complete, valid, and reliable information. Burden of disease estimates provided in this article are for 2001 – the year for which the most recent estimates of the global burden of disease and risk factors are currently available. Causes of deaths were categorized into three main groups: group I (infectious diseases and maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions), group II (noncommunicable diseases), and group III (injuries). Accordingly, estimates of the global burden of infectious diseases are provided in the context of the overall burden from other conditions, diseases, and injuries. The relative importance of the burden of infectious diseases was forecasted to change by 2020. As the epidemiological transition progresses worldwide, a decline in the burden of infectious diseases is expected as the burden of noncommunicable diseases and injuries gradually increases. The pace of the epidemiological transition, however, varies greatly among regions so that the projected decreases in the burden of infectious diseases are expected to vary between regions. Trends in the global burden due to specific infectious diseases projected to 2020 also vary among specific conditions. The global burden of HIV/AIDS, for instance, is expected to greatly increase, whereas the global burden due to respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases is expected to decrease. Contrary to expectations, the global burden of malaria has increased in recent years.",2009-12-31,"Michaud, C.M.",Encyclopedia of Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

The normal human bronchogram shows that the length of pathways from the trachea to the terminal airways differs depending on the pathway followed and it can take as few as 8 or as many as 24 divisions of airway branching to reach the gas-exchanging surface. The small bronchi and bronchioles 2 mm in diameter are spread out from the fourth to the fourteenth generation of airway branching. The pathology of asthma is dominated by widespread plugging of the segmental, subsegmental, and smaller conducting airways that leads to hyperinflation but not destruction of the parenchyma. These airway plugs are a manifestation of the fluid and cellular exudative phase of an inflammatory process based in the airway tissue. The chronic bronchitis of COPD is defined by excess cough with sputum production and is associated with an inflammatory process located in the mucosa, gland ducts, and glands of intermediate-sized bronchi between 2 and 4 mm internal diameter. The airway obstruction in COPD is the result of a similar inflammatory response in the smaller bronchi and bronchioles under 2 mm internal diameter, where the repair process associated with chronic inflammation thickens the airway wall and narrows the lumen to cause fixed airway obstruction.",2009-12-31,"Hogg, James C.",Asthma and COPD,,,True,custom_license

Asthma is a multifaceted syndrome involving atopy, bronchial hyperreactivity, and IgE and non-IgE-mediated acute and chronic immune responses. The asthmatic airway is characterized by an infiltrate of eosinophils and of T-lymphocytes expressing the type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Trigger factors associated with acute exacerbations of asthma include exposure to environmental allergens, especially animals, molds, pollens and mites, cold, exercise, and drugs. The frequency of exacerbations is a major factor in the quality of life of patients with COPD. The typical clinical features of an exacerbation include increased dyspnea, wheezing, cough, sputum production, and worsened gas exchange. Although noninfectious causes of exacerbations such as allergy, air pollution, or inhaled irritants including cigarette smoke may be important, acute airway infections are the major precipitants. The infection and consequent host inflammatory response result in increased airway obstruction. The success of vaccination to prevent respiratory virus infections has been limited by significant variation within the major virus types causing disease. Currently much of the treatment of infective exacerbations of asthma and COPD is symptomatic, consisting of increased bronchodilators, either short-acting β 2—agonists in inhaled or intravenous form or anticholinergics or theophyllines, or supportive in the form of oxygen and in severe cases noninvasive or invasive ventilatory measures.",2009-12-31,"Message, Simon D.; Johnston, Sebastian L.",Asthma and COPD,,,True,custom_license

Such an approach relies upon an accurate diagnosis of an exacerbation, including judicious application of diagnostic tests. Determining the severity of an exacerbation follows this. If antibiotics are indicated, then a risk stratification approach is described to choose an appropriate antibiotic. An increase in airway inflammation from the baseline level in a patient appears central to the pathogenesis of most acute exacerbations. Airway inflammation measured in induced or expectorated sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial biopsy has revealed that increased inflammation accompanies exacerbations and resolves with treatment. Potential pathogens in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations include typical respiratory bacterial pathogens, respiratory viruses, and atypical bacteria. The current model of bacterial exacerbation pathogenesis involves both host and pathogen factors. Acquisition of strains of bacterial pathogens that are new to the host from the environment is the primary event that puts the patient with COPD at risk for an exacerbation. The traditional aims of treatment of an exacerbation are improvement in clinical status and the prevention of complications. The role of antibiotics in the treatment of COPD exacerbations has been a matter of controversy. Even more contentious has been the issue whether antibiotic choice is relevant to clinical outcome of exacerbations. Recommendations for antibiotic use among published guidelines are inconsistent.",2009-12-31,"Sethi, Sanjay",Asthma and COPD,,,True,custom_license

COPD exacerbations increase with increasing severity of COPD. Earlier descriptions of COPD exacerbations had concentrated mainly on studies of hospital admission, though most COPD exacerbations are treated in the community and not associated with hospital admission. Exacerbation frequency is an important determinant of health status in COPD and is thus one of the important outcome measures in COPD. Factors predictive of frequent exacerbations included daily cough and sputum and frequent exacerbations in the previous year. In a further prospective analysis of 504 exacerbations, where daily monitoring was performed, there was some deterioration in symptoms, though no there were significant peak expiratory flow changes. Recovery was longer in the presence of increased dyspnoea or symptoms of a common cold at exacerbation. The changes observed in lung function at exacerbation were smaller than those observed at asthmatic exacerbations. The reasons for the incomplete recovery of symptoms and lung function are not clear, but may involve inadequate treatment or persistence of the causative agent. The incomplete physiological recovery after an exacerbation could contribute to the decline in lung function with time in patients with COPD. The association of the symptoms of increased dyspnoea and of the common cold at exacerbation with a prolonged recovery suggests that viral infections may lead to more prolonged exacerbations.",2009-12-31,"Wedzicha, Jadwiga A.",Asthma and COPD,,,True,custom_license

Although these separate substantive areas agree that epidemiology refers to the distribution of disease in a population and the determinants of that distribution, the literature presents conflicting definitions of what makes a study a molecular epidemiologic study. In cancer and environmental epidemiology, molecular is defined almost exclusively in terms of biomarkers. However, biomarkers are only one type of molecular measure, and this definition ignores the many applications of molecular methods in genetic and infectious disease epidemiology. Early epidemiologists made tremendous strides with what are now relatively simple molecular tools, such as using microscopy for identification, showing agents not visible by microscope cause disease, and detecting protective antibodies with hemagglutination assays. In the microbiology literature, molecular epidemiology has become synonymous with the use of molecular fingerprints—regardless of whether the study was population based or met other criteria consistent with an epidemiologic study. Moreover, the molecular tools available, and the potential for applications for studies of populations, have changed substantially since the term molecular epidemiology was coined.",2012-12-31,"Foxman, Betsy",Molecular Tools and Infectious Disease Epidemiology,,,True,custom_license

Although it is assumed during an outbreak that a single microbe is causing the clinical symptoms, it is possible that a microbe of the same genus and species but different strain is causing disease during the same time period. Molecular typing can distinguish between outbreak and nonoutbreak strains. Molecular tools also facilitate estimating parameters key to understanding the transmission system, including the incidence, prevalence, transmission probability, duration of carriage, effective dose, and probability of effective contact. Molecular tools enable one to trace the dissemination of a particular subtype across time and space and thus develop theories of transmission and dissemination, determine the origin of an epidemic and test theories about reservoirs and evolution of a particular pathogen, follow the emergence of new infections as they cross species, testing the hypotheses about the apparent transmissibility and rate of evolution, and follow mobile genetic elements conferring antimicrobial resistance or virulence between strains within a species or between species, and so develop theories about evolution and transmission within the populations of pathogens.",2012-12-31,"Foxman, Betsy",Molecular Tools and Infectious Disease Epidemiology,,,True,custom_license

Repeated samples from the same individual will indicate if the measure varies with time of day, menstrual cycle, or consumption of food or liquids. The extent that this impacts the reliability will dictate if the protocol should stipulate timing of specimen collection. The dynamics of colonization of human body sites by microbes are essentially unknown. Currently there are few estimates in the literature of how frequently there is a change in the bacterial strains (or other colonizing microbes) that commonly colonize the human gut, mouth, vaginal cavity, and skin. Also unknown is the average duration of carriage. There are some estimates for group B Streptococcus; colonization is very dynamic, with an average duration of carriage of ∼14 weeks among women. This suggests that assessments of reliability must be done over a short time, and that loss over 2-week period could as easily reflect true loss as sampling error.",2012-12-31,"Foxman, Betsy",Molecular Tools and Infectious Disease Epidemiology,,,True,custom_license

The complexity of mutant spectra can influence disease progression and viral pathogenesis, as demonstrated using virus variants selected for increased replicative fidelity. Complementation and interference exerted among components of a viral quasispecies can either reinforce or limit the replicative capacity and disease potential of the ensemble. In particular, a progressive enrichment of a replicating mutant spectrum with interfering mutant genomes prompted by enhanced mutagenesis may be a key event in the sharp transition of virus populations into error catastrophe that leads to virus extinction. Fitness variations are influenced by the passage regimes to which viral populations are subjected, notably average fitness decreases upon repeated bottleneck events and fitness gains upon competitive optimization of large viral populations. Evolving viral quasispecies respond to selective constraints by replication of subpopulations of variant genomes that display higher fitness than the parental population in the presence of the selective constraint. This has been profusely documented with fitness effects of mutations associated with resistance of pathogenic viruses to antiviral agents. In particular, selection of HIV-1 mutants resistant to one or multiple antiretroviral inhibitors, and the compensatory effect of mutations in the same genome, offers a compendium of the molecular intricacies that a virus can exploit for its survival.

Originally concerned with disease and its emergence, virus evolution had not been well integrated into the general study of evolution. This chapter reviews the developments that have brought us to this new appreciation for the general significance of virus evolution to all life. We now know that viruses numerically dominate all habitats of life, especially the oceans. Theoretical developments in the 1970s regarding quasispecies, error rates, and error thresholds have yielded many practical insights into virus–host dynamics. The human diseases of HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus cannot be understood without this evolutionary framework. Yet recent developments with poliovirus demonstrate that viral fitness can be the result of a consortia, not one fittest type, a basic Darwinian concept in evolutionary biology. Darwinian principles do apply to viruses, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution distinguish virus evolution from classical studies. The available phylogenetic tools have greatly aided our analysis of virus evolution, but these methods struggle to characterize the role of virus populations. Missing from many of these considerations has been the major role played by persisting viruses in stable virus evolution and disease emergence. In many cases, extreme stability is seen with persisting RNA viruses. Indeed, examples are known in which it is the persistently infected host that has better survival. We have also recently come to appreciate the vast diversity of phage (DNA viruses) of prokaryotes as a system that evolves by genetic exchanges across vast populations (Chapter 10). This has been proposed to be the “big bang” of biological evolution. In the large DNA viruses of aquatic microbes we see surprisingly large, complex and diverse viruses. With both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA viruses, recombination is the main engine of virus evolution, and virus host co-evolution is common, although not uniform. Viral emergence appears to be an unending phenomenon and we can currently witness a selective sweep by retroviruses that infect and become endogenized in koala bears.",2008-12-31,"Villarreal, Luis P.",Origin and Evolution of Viruses,,,True,custom_license

An urgent worldwide threat is posed by the introduction and spread of novel infectious diseases. The reasons for emerging infectious diseases are numerous and complex. Among the most significant explanations for these emerging diseases are changes in environment and ecology caused by natural phenomena such as droughts, hurricanes, and floods; and human-made phenomena such as agricultural development, urbanization, and denuding of forests. Worldwide conflict, including wars, ethnic cleansing, and genocide, have led to displacement of large populations into overcrowded settlements where safe water is not available and sanitation is poor. For example, unsanitary conditions led to a huge increase in the rat population in post-war Kosovo, resulting in a tularemia outbreak with 327 confirmed cases in 8 months. Regional conflict leads to breakdown in infection control, inadequate surveillance, impeded access to populations, and spread of infectious diseases through movement of refugees and aid workers. Increased precipitation, a result of climate change, leads to more agricultural run-off, allowing pathogens to enter drinking water systems. In developing countries where poverty and inadequate infrastructure are the norm, public health monitoring systems must be supported and improved so that new or more severe risks to health can be identified and curtailed. As new infectious diseases are recognized, critical issues arise regarding pregnant women and their unborn children.

Recently published data from the Center for Disease Control's Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System indicates that although maternal mortality from hemorrhage, embolism, and anesthesia has declined in the United States, the proportion of maternal deaths due to infections has increased. During 1991–7 infection accounted for 13.2% of pregnancy-related deaths overall and 36.3% of abortion-related deaths. The greatest infection risk is found in blacks, older women, women without prenatal care, and women with multiple pregnancy. In the United States pregnancy rates are stable or increasing in these groups. Infection is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality for the fetus and newborn. Many perinatal infections are associated with intra-uterine growth retardation and low birthweight, or cause fetal and neonatal brain injury. Infections, particularly bacterial vaginosis and chorioamnionitis, can result in preterm delivery of live-born infants (delivery before 37 weeks gestation), or stillbirth. A multitude of immunologic, endocrinologic, metabolic, physiologic, and anatomic changes influence the likelihood and course of many infections during pregnancy.

This is true whether virus replication is restricted to a single site, for example, the respiratory tract (RT), CNS etc., or replication is in multiple sites throughout the body. In describing below the acute T cell response to virus infection, we employ acute virus infection of the RT as a convenient model to explore this process of virus infection and the host response.

As basic immunological science intersects with the practicalities of assuring vaccine safety, tolerability, efficacy, and consistency in the clinic, the practical utility of more sophisticated immunological measures for vaccine development may be determined by whether they can be reduced to simply executed, highly standardized, reproducible assays with outcomes that have clear interpretations for vaccine development and use.

Early restriction of virus replication is accomplished by the innate immune response upon activation of pattern recognition receptors in resident cells.

Proper attention to the growth of heifers is paramount to producing heifers that achieve adequate stature and body weight before first breeding and calving. Timely entry of heifers into the milking herd by 2 years of age, or their first eligible calving season in seasonal pasture-based dairy enterprises, can be facilitated by applying synchronization of estrus and ovulation in addition to traditional detection of estrus by visual or other means. Because fertility is better in heifers than in lactating cows, artificial insemination of heifers with semen from the best available progeny-tested bulls is a wise investment to ensure genetic gain of economically important traits. Annual culling rates of 25–33% necessitate a supply of herd replacement heifers. Application of gender-biased semen to produce more female offspring is also warranted for increasing the replacement population. The main goal of a heifer replacement program is to develop heifers at minimal cost and in a timely manner to obtain heifers of desired size and body weight so that they attain puberty, establish pregnancy, calve easily, and achieve their maximum genetic lifetime milk production as cows.",2011-12-31,"Stevenson, J.S.; Ahmadzadeh, A.",Encyclopedia of Dairy Sciences,,,True,custom_license

Assembly of virus particles occurs at internal membranes. The genes for the structural proteins are at the 3′ end of the genome. Most of the genome (∼20kb) is gene 1, which encodes 15–16 proteins associated with RNA replication and transcription. Translation of gene 1 involves ribosomal frameshifting. Transcription is by a discontinuous process which results in a 3′ co-terminal nested set of mRNAs, each of which has a common leader sequence transcribed from the 5′ terminus of the genome. Only the most 5′-proximal gene of each mRNA is translated. Recombination is a feature of coronavirus evolution.

Much later it was shown that immunity is transferable by serum. The active serum components were identified to be immunoglobulins (Ig's), called antibodies. The enormous diversity of antibodies specific for distinct viruses, pathogens, and many other antigens is explained by clonal selection, whereby specific B-lymphocyte receptors recognize a particular antigen. The selected B-cells are triggered to undergo replication. A process of further cell differentiation and maturation ensues, leading to secretion of antibodies with high binding affinity toward the triggering antigen. Genes coding for the variable regions (involved in antigen binding) of Ig's are inherited as sets of gene fragments joined to form a complete gene in individual B-cells. This process and further hypermutations ensure the synthesis of diverse high affinity antibodies. The antibodies consist of pairs of light (L) and heavy (H) polypeptide chains. Variations in the constant portion of H-chains lead to production of Ig isotypes (IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE, and IgG (further subdivided into IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4)), each having distinct effector functions. Host exposure to viruses leads to the production of antibodies with more than one specificity. Only some of these antibodies, recognizing so-called virus neutralization epitopes, diminish or eliminate virus infectivity. Other virus-specific antibodies play auxiliary roles or are ineffective. Sometimes antibodies cause enhancement of viral diseases or play a role in evasion of the immune system. Many antiviral immunoglobulins are being used for short-term pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapy. Long-term protective effects can be accomplished only by antibodies elicited by successful vaccination relying on the phenomenon of immunological memory. T-lymphocytes play a major role in initiating and maintaining immunity against subsequent virus exposure. Antibodies are one of the essential features of antigen triggered adaptive immunity.

In an effort to augment the capabilities of existing diagnostic methodologies, the use of virus-specific DNA microarray technology has been recently applied in both research and clinical settings with favorable results. The primary advantage of this approach is that DNA microarrays containing literally thousands of virus-specific sequences allow simultaneous testing for essentially all known viral species. While previous methods have been limited to testing for a single pathogen, or small numbers of specific pathogens, a panviral assay is less biased and can be designed to detect variant or even novel members of existing viral families. The use of DNA microarrays in both research and clinical settings has the potential to substantially increase the number of instances in which a virus may be identified in biological samples. With the proper bioinformatics methodologies, this technology will also maximize the probability that previously uncharacterized pathogens are detected potentially leading to an improved understanding of the etiology for many chronic human diseases.

Yet viruses dominate our planet and their evolution is a broad and applied field that can be studied in the real time (such HIV in human disease) and can also be applied to biotechnological problems. Virus evolution is very similar, but not identical, to host evolution. Darwinian principles apply, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution, distinguish virus evolution. In RNA viruses, high error rates have led to the quasispecies concept in which collective populations are the basis of evolution. These populations provide viruses with high capacities for adaptation. Yet some RNA viruses show remarkable evolutionary stability. With DNA viruses, especially of bacteria, extensive recombination defines vast dynamic and ancient genetic pools. Temperate viruses can directly affect host gene pools by stable colonization. DNA viruses can be genetically complex and have evolved many unique viral genes. The retroviruses show both quasispecies-based rapid evolution and host-linked slow coevolution (e.g., endogenous retroviruses).

Viruses may evolve at high, uneven, and fluctuating rates among genome sites. The accumulated changes, through either mutation or recombination with other species, are first fixed in the genome of successful individuals that give rise to genetic lineages. The relationship between biological lineages related by common descent is called ‘phylogeny’. For inferring phylogeny, the differences between aligned sequences of genomes and proteins are quantified and depicted in the form of a tree, in which contemporary species and their intermediate and common ancestors occupy, respectively, the terminal nodes, internal nodes, and the root. The tree is characterized by a topology, length of branches, shape, and the root position. A complex mathematical apparatus has been developed for phylogeny inference that can evaluate inter-species differences, facilitate tree building and comparison of trees, and assess the fit between data and tree through, typically, computationally intensive calculations. A reconstructed tree is an approximation of the true phylogeny that practically remains unknown. The phylogenetic analysis is used in applied and fundamental virus research, including epidemiology, diagnostics, forensic studies, phylogeography, evolutionary studies, and virus taxonomy.

They infect a broad range of hosts, including humans, other mammals, birds, fish, and shrimp. Nidovirus infection starts by binding to a receptor on the cell surface, and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes mediated by one of the major surface glycoproteins. Following genome uncoating, the translation of the two overlapping replicase open reading frames (ORFs) yields two large polyprotein precursors that undergo autoproteolysis to produce the mature nonstructural proteins that eventually assemble into a membrane-bound, replication–transcription complex. The complex, which also contains several cellular proteins, mediates negative-strand RNA synthesis, amplification of the genome RNA, and production of a nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs (sg mRNAs). Whereas nidovirus genome replication proceeds through the synthesis of a full-length negative-strand RNA, transcription involves the synthesis of subgenome-length, negative-strand templates for mRNA synthesis. In arteriviruses and coronaviruses, and probably bafiniviruses, transcription involves a mechanism of discontinuous negative-strand synthesis (template switch) to equip each subgenomic RNA with a 5′ common leader sequence identical to the genomic 5′ end. Except for the largest torovirus sg RNA, torovirus and ronivirus sgRNAs do not share such a common leader sequence and discontinuous RNA synthesis does not appear to be involved in this case.

The disease first emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China and spread globally within months. The SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) affects multiple organ systems with severe viral pneumonia as its main clinical manifestation but with diarrhea, lymphopenia, and mild liver dysfunction being common extra-pulmonary manifestations. Increasing age and the presence of underlying respiratory diseases worsens the prognosis. Unlike other respiratory viral infections, transmission of SARS was less frequent in the first 5days of illness and correlated with low viral load in the upper respiratory tract at this stage of the illness. This fortuitous feature of the disease allowed the public health measures of case detection and patient isolation to interrupt virus transmission in the community and abort the SARS outbreak. Bats are a reservoir of a virus closely related to SARS CoV and this may be the likely precursor from which the human-adapted SARS CoV emerged. Small mammals such as ‘civet-cats’ (Paguma larvata) within live animal markets in southern China serve as amplifiers of infection and these markets were the likely interface where zoonotic transmission occurred.

Pathology refers to the specialty of medical science concerned with the cause, development, structural/functional changes, and natural history associated with diseases. Disease refers to a definable deviation from a normal phenotype (observable characteristics due to genome and environment), evident via patient complaints (symptoms), and/or the measurements of a careful observer (signs). The cause of the disease is referred to as its etiology. One disease entity can have more than one etiology, and one etiology can lead to more than one disease. Each disease entity develops through a series of mechanistic chemical and cellular steps. This stepwise process of disease development is referred to as its pathogenesis. Pathogenesis can refer to the changes in the structure or function of an organism at the gross/clinical level and the stepwise molecular abnormalities leading to changes in cellular and tissue function. The presentation of a disease to a clinician is in the form of a human patient with variably specific complaints (symptoms), to which the examining physicians can add diagnostic sensitivity and specificity by making observations (screening for signs of diseases).",2009-12-31,"Funkhouser, William K.",Molecular Pathology,,,True,custom_license

Every breath that a human takes brings the outside world into the body in the form of infectious agents, organic and inorganic particles, and noxious agents of all types. Although the lung has many defense mechanisms to protect itself from these insults, these are not infallible; therefore, lung pathology arises. Damage to the lung is particularly important given the role of the lung in the survival of the organism. Any impairment of lung function has widespread effects throughout the body, since all organs depend on the lungs for the oxygen they need. Pulmonary pathology catalogs the changes in the lung tissues and the mechanisms through which these occur.

DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin receptor that recognizes N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides and branched fucosylated structures. It is now clear that the biological role of DC-SIGN is two-fold. It is primarily expressed by dendritic cells and mediates important functions necessary for the induction of successful immune responses that are essential for the clearance of microbial infections, such as the capture, destruction, and presentation of microbial pathogens to induce successful immune responses. Yet, on the other hand, pathogens may also exploit DC-SIGN to modulate DC functioning thereby skewing the immune response and promoting their own survival. This chapter presents an overview of the structure of DC-SIGN and its expression pattern among immune cells. The current state of knowledge of DC-SIGN-carbohydrate interactions is discussed and how these interactions influence dendritic cell functioning is examined.

Main waterborne diseases, mostly affecting developing countries and relevant in terms of water management and changes in land use, such as malaria, schistosomiasis, or cholera, are discussed stressing links to the global water crisis. Also, the role of artificial and natural wetlands in influenza epidemics is treated. The effects of increasing water use and scarcity on human health are discussed considering historical and contemporary incidence of diarrheal diseases in European and South Asian megacities, relationships between dams and on waterborne diseases in Asia and Africa, and intensive agri- and aquaculture resulting in man-made ecotones, fragmented aquatic ecosystems, and pathogen mutations.

This chapter focuses on two aspects of the host response to pathogens where major advances are being made using genomic approaches. The availability of complete genomic sequences of an expanding number of pathogens, the human and mouse genome sequences, and the advent of genome-wide genotyping and gene expression profiling has opened up new avenues of investigation in the field. The genotype of the pathogen plays a major role in the response of the host to infection with more virulent pathogenic strains possessing the capability to interfere with the host immune response. In addition, different individuals in a population can have very different responses to a genetically identical pathogen. Part of the differential response is governed by the underlying genetic differences between individuals. The advent of genome-wide genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms or microsatellite markers is leading to major advances in molecular epidemiology. The future impact of genomic approaches on the development of diagnostics and therapeutics is discussed for infectious diseases.

They are involved in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the leader sequence may vary from few nucleotides to more than 1000 nucleotides. In prokaryotes, the leader sequences are usually short and at times contain an attenuator segment that is translated to a short-leader peptide. The leader peptide functions to terminate transcripts before the RNA polymerase reaches the first structural gene of the operon. The leader sequences in viruses have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, replication, and pathogenicity.

Its origins involved the replacement of centuries-old beliefs and theories with discoveries borne out of rigorous scientific investigation. Targeted prevention and control strategies could only be developed and implemented once the concept of the specificity of disease causation had been accepted, namely that infectious diseases are caused not by some common miasma (a mysteriously poisonous substance), but rather by specific agents. In a wider sense, the microbial sciences have played a pivotal role in the development of medical thought, particularly in applying scientific rigor in understanding pathological processes. Advances in understanding of infectious agents have led to improvements in human health and well-being that arguably have exceeded the contribution of any other branch of science.

It states that the origins of veterinary medicine are rooted in efforts to maintain the health of animals for food and fiber production and animals essential for work-related activities. The early phase of virology was one of skepticism and uncertainty because of the limited tools available to define the filterable agents. Even with filtration, there were differences among the agents as to their size as defined by filter retention. The bacterial viruses assisted in defining some of the basic principles of genetics through the study of mutations and the inheritance of phenotypic changes. Veterinary virology began as a discipline focusing on the effects of viral infections on animals of agricultural significance. Control of these infections relied on advances in understanding the disease process, in the characterization of the viruses, in the development of the fields of immunology and diagnostic technologies, and in the establishment of regulations controlling the movement of production animals. Initial experiences confirmed that eradication of some infectious diseases from defined areas could be achieved with a test and slaughter program, even in the absence of an effective vaccine.

2300,,Elsevier,Chapter 2 Virus Replication,10.1016/B978-0-12-375158-4.00002-X,,,els-covid,"Publisher Summary This chapter describes virus replication. Before the development of in vitro cell culture techniques, all viruses had to be propagated in their natural host. For bacterial viruses, this was a relatively simple process that permitted an earlier development of laboratory research methods than was possible with plant or animal viruses. For animal viruses, samples from affected animals were collected and used to infect other animals, initially of the same species. When consistent results were obtained, attempts were usually made to determine whether other species might also be susceptible. This chapter explains that the advent of in vitro animal cell culture brought research studies in line with those involving bacterial viruses, thereby reducing the risks associated with adventitious viruses in animal inoculation systems and enhancing diagnostic testing. Various in vitro cell culture systems are used since an artificial medium was developed to maintain cell viability outside the source species: organ cultures, explant cultures, primary cell cultures, and cell lines. Organ cultures maintain the three-dimensional structure of the tissue and are used for short-term experiments. A fundamental characteristic that separates viruses from other replicating entities is the manner in which new virus particles are synthesized. Viruses do not use binary fission; virus particles are assembled de novo from the various structural components synthesized as somewhat independent but synchronized events. The critical first step in the virus replication cycle is the binding of the virus particle to a host cell. This binding process may involve a series of interactions that define in part the host range of the virus and its tissue/organ specificity.",2011-12-31,,Fenner's Veterinary Virology,,,False,custom_license
2301,,Elsevier,Chapter 3 Pathogenesis of Viral Infections and Diseases,10.1016/B978-0-12-375158-4.00003-1,,,els-covid,"Publisher Summary Viruses first infect their host, then spread, and then damage their target tissues. To ensure their perpetuation, viruses must be transmitted to other susceptible individuals—that is, they must be shed with secretions or excretions into the environment, be taken up by another host or a vector, or be passed congenitally from mother to offspring. Viruses have developed a remarkable variety of strategies to ensure their own survival. Individual viruses cause their associated diseases through a considerable variety of distinct pathogenic mechanisms. Viruses differ greatly in their virulence, but even in a population infected by a particular virus strain, there are usually striking differences in the outcome of infection of individual animals. Similarly, there is much variation among viruses of the same species, and the determinants of viral virulence are often multigenic, meaning that several viral genes contribute to the virulence of individual viruses. The determinants of host resistance/susceptibility are usually multifactorial and include not only a variety of host factors but environmental ones as well. There is wide variation in the virulence of viruses, ranging from those that almost always cause inapparent infections, to those that usually cause disease, to those that usually cause death. Meaningful comparison of the virulence of viruses requires that factors such as the infecting dose of the virus and the age, sex, and condition of the host animals and their immune status be equal; however, these conditions are never met in nature, where heterogeneous, outbred animal populations are the rule and the dynamics of exposure and viral infection are incredibly varied.",2011-12-31,,Fenner's Veterinary Virology,,,False,custom_license
2302,,Elsevier,Chapter 4 Antiviral Immunity and Prophylaxis,10.1016/B978-0-12-375158-4.00004-3,,,els-covid,"Publisher Summary This chapter argues that antiviral immunity in animals is mediated by both cellular and humoral factors, and the nature of the immune response generated by different individuals infected with the same virus can be different, depending on the individual's genetic constitution, environmental influences, and other factors that can determine the course and pathogenesis of the infection. Innate immune defenses exhibit neither antigen specificity nor memory, but they provide a critical line of first defense against viral infections because they are constantly present and are operational immediately after viral infection. Innate immunity is often considered separate from acquired immune responses, but they are inextricably linked, and innate responses modulate subsequent acquired responses in many ways. Viruses that are transmitted horizontally between individuals must first breach the barriers at their portal of entry before they can cause infection in their respective hosts. In the ongoing war and détente between virus and host, viruses have developed remarkably sophisticated mechanisms to avoid the various host protective responses. Vaccination is the most effective way of preventing viral diseases. There are some important differences between vaccination practices in humans and animals. The immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines, especially that of purified protein vaccines and synthetic peptides, usually needs to be enhanced; this may be achieved by mixing the antigen with an adjuvant, incorporation of the antigen in liposomes, or incorporation of the antigen in an immunostimulating complex.",2011-12-31,,Fenner's Veterinary Virology,,,False,custom_license

Most available routine tests are agent dependent—that is, they are designed to detect a specific virus and will give a negative test result even if other viruses are present in the sample. For this reason, agent-independent tests such as virus isolation and electron microscopy are still used to identify the unexpected or unknown agent in a clinical sample. Traditional methods such as virus isolation are still widely used; however, many are too slow to have any direct influence on the clinical management of an index case. For some economically important viruses, standardized diagnostic tests and reagents of good quality are available commercially; assays have been miniaturized to conserve reagents and decrease costs; instruments have been developed to automate tests, again often decreasing costs; and computerized analyses aid in making the interpretation of results as objective as possible in addition to facilitating reporting, record keeping, and billing.

The risk of infection and disease in an animal or animal population is determined by characteristics of the virus, the host and host population, and behavioral, environmental, and ecological factors that affect virus transmission from one host to another. Epidemiology, which is part of the science of population biology, attempts to meld these factors into a unified population-based perspective. The word epidemiology is widely used now no matter what host is concerned; the words endemic, epidemic, and pandemic are used to characterize disease states in human populations, and enzootic, epizootic, and panzootic are their equivalents in animal populations. By introducing quantitative measurements of disease trends, epidemiology has come to have a major role in advancing our understanding of the nature of diseases and in alerting and directing disease-control activities. Epidemiologic study is also effective in clarifying the role of viruses in the etiology of diseases, in understanding the interaction of viruses with environmental determinants of disease, in determining factors affecting host susceptibility, in unraveling modes of transmission, and in large-scale testing of vaccines and drugs. The case definition is a critical component of rates and proportions that should be standardized to allow comparison of disease occurrence in different populations and subpopulations. Criteria can be specified for confirmed, probable, and possible cases, depending on whether the selected criteria are pathognomonic for the viral disease of interest and whether laboratory results are available for all cases.

Emerging infections have the potential to cause severe human illness and death, and to spread among human populations and across geographic borders. Direct costs associated with emerging infections are often high, caused by prolonged patient management, hospitalization, and convalescence. Indirect costs are caused by absenteeism from work, death, and permanent removal from the workforce. There may be additional costs if precautionary prevention measures are required, based on the known or potential risk. These costs result from culling and prohibited trade in animals and animal-based products if infected animals are a continuing threat to humans; or from postponement or cancellation of travel and tourism if transmission in the general population is uncontrolled. Emerging infections sometimes cause panic and/or fear because of misunderstanding of the risk, and can lead to actions that result in economic loss similar to that caused by legitimate public health precautionary measures. They include reactions such as avoiding animal-based foods mistakenly thought to be the source of infection; unnecessary cancelling travel plans to avoid geographic areas where there is a perception of risk of infection; and/or unwarranted culling of animals or destruction of animal-based foods. If the misunderstanding is transmitted widely by the press or through social media networks, the negative economic impact can be amplified. Economic loss caused by these perceived risks can generally not be disentangled from the losses causes by public health measures that may be in place, but it is thought that at times they add significantly to the economic burden. The International Health Regulations (IHR) were designed to respond to the international spread of infectious disease outbreaks in a manner that prevents unnecessary negative economic impacts. Agreed by all Member States of the World Health Organization in 2005, they are a legally binding global agreement with the specific purpose of ensuring maximum security against the international spread of diseases, with a minimum interference in world traffic and trade. They reflect current understanding of infectious disease risks, especially those that emerge at the animal/human interface; the realization that infectious diseases cannot be stopped from entering countries at borders; the vast increase in access to information through the internet; and globalization that increases the speed with which infectious diseases spread. Under the IHR, countries are able to work transparently with WHO and its scientific experts and collaborating laboratories to conduct joint risk assessments of public health events such as outbreaks of infectious diseases; to make evidence-based recommendations to help prevent or control their international spread; and, by providing valid and transparent information to national focal points, to help prevent unnecessary panic and misunderstanding about risk.",2014-12-31,"Heymann, D.L.; Reinhardt, K.",Encyclopedia of Health Economics,,,True,custom_license

This fusion process is catalyzed by one or several viral glycoproteins incorporated on the membrane of the virus. These envelope glycoproteins (EnvGP) evolved in order to combine two features. First, they acquired a domain to bind to a specific cellular protein, named “receptor.” Second, they developed, with the help of cellular proteins, a function of finely controlled fusion to optimize the replication and preserve the integrity of the cell, specific to the genus of the virus. Following the activation of the EnvGP either by binding to their receptors and/or sometimes the acid pH of the endosomes, many changes of conformation permit ultimately the action of a specific hydrophobic domain, the fusion peptide, which destabilizes the cell membrane and leads to the opening of the lipidic membrane. The comprehension of these mechanisms is essential to develop medicines of the therapeutic class of entry inhibitor like enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this chapter, we will summarize the different envelope glycoprotein structures that viruses develop to achieve membrane fusion and the entry of the virus. We will describe the different entry pathways and cellular proteins that viruses have subverted to allow infection of the cell and the receptors that are used. Finally, we will illustrate more precisely the recent discoveries that have been made within the field of the entry process, with a focus on the use of pseudoparticles.

The likelihood of such transmission is increased when changes in the environment place different species in close proximity. Similarly, transmission of viral agents from nonprimate host to primate host may result in severe disease. Perhaps of equal importance is the realization that experimental manipulations may inadvertently expose animals to unrecognized pathogens with lethal consequences. For instance, a number of minimally pathogenic viruses may cause severe disease in animals immunosuppressed from pharmacologic manipulation or immunodeficient from concurrent infection with viruses that target the immune system.

The development of drugs that target dynein activities during viral replication rely on the disruption of characterized and specific interactions between viral proteins and dynein. Because viruses are parasitic in nature, great reason exists to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell protein function and viruses’ dependence on these for additional rounds of infection. Some viral infections induce the assembly of stress granules, including reovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, but others block their assembly during infection. Considering this dependence on dynein activity for assembly, it is possible that viruses co-opt factors of the dynein motor complex during infection, but as a consequence either induce or silence stress granule assembly. This is an emerging field of endeavor, but stress granules and other silencing ribonucleoprotein bodies may represent “dangerous” areas and structures of the cell that viral replication complexes, proteins, and RNAs/DNAs would need to avoid guaranteeing expression and survival. There is research support for the presence of both dynein and kinesin motors driving viral components toward assembly sites. Several viruses, including poxviruses and the vaccinia virus, replicate in cytoplasmic virus factories. Paradoxically, regulatory genes of various viruses enhance and disrupt microtubule integrity and polarization, but this may directly relate to the timing of the replication cycle.

Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on earth. These obligate parasites infect every form of life, from archaea and eubacteria to fungi, plants, and animals. Viruses play key roles in global ecology—they form a vast reservoir of genetic diversity, influence the composition and evolution of host populations, and affect the cycling of chemical compounds through the environment. Research has focused on the tiny fraction that causes disease in humans, domestic animals, and crops; sequencing surveys have suggested that the majority of viruses are completely unknown. The ability of viruses to jump species barriers, move between habitats, and circle the globe rapidly underscores the importance of continued vigilance for naturally emerging or deliberately engineered outbreaks. Viruses are extremely simple “life” forms without metabolic capacity, organelles, translational machinery, or autonomous replicative potential. Virus particles constitute a minimal set of components, primarily those required to deliver the genome to the target cell and initiate replication. Consequently, virus particles (or virions) are extremely small, most in the range of 20 to 200 nm in diameter. Virions are diverse not only in size but also in composition, morphology, and genome characteristics. Virus particles may be irregular in shape or possess a distinct symmetry, such as helical or icosahedral. Particles may be surrounded by a host-derived membrane, termed “enveloped,” or a tight protein shell, termed “nonenveloped.”",2011-12-31,"Murray, Catherine L.; Oh, Thomas S.; Rice, Charles M.",Microbial Forensics,,,True,custom_license

It may aid an investigation to distinguish a perpetrator from a victim who has been exposed to a particular microorganism or by-product, such as a toxin. Considerable advances have been made in the forensic analysis of microbes and toxins. These advances include sequencing, genomics, and microscopy. An underdeveloped and underutilized area in microbial forensics is how the host interacts with microorganisms in a way that provides unique signatures for forensic use. For investigative and forensic purposes, an immediate goal is to distinguish a potential victim and innocent person from a perpetrator and to distinguish between a naturally acquired or intentional infection. Two principal methods that are sufficiently developed are characterization of the humoral immune response and identification of vaccine-induced immunity or antibiotics that may be present in a possible perpetrator. The primary aims of a microbial forensics investigation are to identify the biological agent, its source, and the individuals responsible for the event. Analytic approaches differ when the suspected biothreat agent is encountered in a container or the environment, as opposed to in vivoin a human, animal, or plant. Analyses of trace elements, pollens, growth media, latent fingerprints, and microbial and nonmicrobial nucleic acids are all applicable to the container and environmental sample.",2011-12-31,"Schutzer, Steven E.",Microbial Forensics,,,True,custom_license

Genomic signature-based identification techniques have the advantage of being precise, highly sensitive, and relatively fast in comparison to biochemical typing methods and protein signatures. Classic biochemical typing methods were developed long before knowledge of DNA and resulted in dozens of tests that are used to roughly characterize the major known pathogens. Genomic signatures can be intended for many different purposes and applied at multiple different resolutions. Organism signatures are intended to uniquely identify the organisms involved. Mechanism signatures can be best thought of as identifying particular genes that result in functional properties such as virulence, antibiotic resistance, or host range. The primary reason to identify mechanisms, independent of organisms, is to detect potential genetic engineering. A secondary reason is that nature has shared many important mechanisms on its own over the millennia, and thus they may not be sufficiently unique to identify specific organisms. Method signatures present yet another dimension of analyzing pathogens: evidence of potential bacterial genetic engineering may be seen in a genome by checking for traces of the bacterial vectors that may have been used to insert one or more foreign genes and related components into the genome being modified.",2011-12-31,"Slezak, Tom; Gardner, Shea; Allen, Jonathan; Vitalis, Elizabeth; Torres, Marisa; Torres, Clinton; Jaing, Crystal",Microbial Forensics,,,True,custom_license

Bioterrorism remains a real threat, but because actual incidents remain at a low level, complacency is a constant enemy; hence the continuing background of false alarms may indeed be beneficial, encouraging responding agencies to keep practiced and alert. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) model of an integrated intelligence and forensic approach is a useful model for other nations of similar size or maturity to consider as a measured contribution to a whole of government approach to threats posed by bioterrorism. The Australian microbial forensic capability is reliant on the combined and coordinated efforts of numerous government facilities, departments, and agencies within law enforcement and public health at the state, territory, and commonwealth levels, as well as the private sector. It is a shining example of how a coordinated effort can provide a comprehensive capability that does well to protect the Australian community. The AFP and Australian Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Data Center also work closely with international law enforcement partners in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The contribution of these and other international partners can be understated in the ongoing united effort to protect the citizens and assets of Australia and other countries against bioterrorism.",2011-12-31,"Roffey, Paul E.; Robertson, James",Microbial Forensics,,,True,custom_license

This evolution includes technology, analytical capabilities, and, equally as important, education and training. The scientific bases, applications, interpretations, and lessons learned by those who have been intimately involved in the early years of microbial forensics need to be documented and transferred to the next generation of scientists and decision makers so that we can protect society from potential harm resulting from bioterrorism and biocrime. The burgeoning field of microbial forensics should be accompanied by a parallel development of educational infrastructure and resources targeted at the next generation of practitioners, as well as diverse elements for the policy, research, and law enforcement communities. A microbial forensics education program can be broad, providing information encompassing all aspects of the field from science to policy, or more focused depending on its purpose and target audience. Policy makers must have a general understanding of microbial forensics results and better appreciation of their implications in order to effect sound and defensible policy decisions. Finally, an important group that informs the public and government is the news media. They are frequently the primary interface between the scientist and the public, making their observations, insights, or inaccuracies of great importance and impact. Educational efforts will better prepare such individuals to be informed and responsible and must be varied in depth and scope to match the target audience of various entities involved in microbial forensics.",2011-12-31,"Schutzer, Steven E.; Budowle, Bruce; Keim, Paul S.",Microbial Forensics,,,True,custom_license

The nidoviruses genome is an infectious, linear, positive sense RNA molecule, which is capped and polyadenylated. Based on the genome size, they are divided into two groups large and small nidoviruses. The genomes of the large nidoviruses are well over 25 kb in length with size differences in the 5 kb range. Based on the genome size, they can be distinguished into two groups, large and small nidoviruses. The genomes of the large nidoviruses are well over 25 kb in length with size differences in the 5 kb range. Although the structural proteins of the nidoviruses are generally functionally equivalent, there is no firm indication that any single protein species is evolutionary conserved across all of the families. Members of the family Coronaviridae generally possess three or four envelope proteins. The most abundant one is the membrane (M) protein. Though different in sequence, the M proteins of corona-, toro-, and bafiniviruses are alike in size, structure, and presumably also in function. Nidoviruses have lipid envelopes, which are commonly acquired by budding at membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, intermediate compartment and/or Golgi complex. In coronaviruses, the S protein is an important target for T cell responses and is the major inducer of virus-neutralizing antibodies, which are elicited by epitopes located mostly in the N-terminal half of the molecule.",2012-12-31,,Virus Taxonomy,,,True,custom_license

The member genera include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, Torovirus, and Bafinivirus. The members of the family Coronaviridae are enveloped and positive stranded RNA viruses of three classes of vertebrates, which include corona- and toroviruses for mammals, coronaviruses for birds, and bafiniviruses for fishes. The nucleocapsids are helical and can be released from the virion by treatment with detergents. Where the coronavirus nucleocapsid appears to be loosely wound, those of the Torovirinae are distinctively tubular. The entire replication cycle takes place in the cytoplasm and involves the production of full-length and subgenome-sized (sg) minus-strand RNA intermediates with the viral genome serving both as mRNA for the replicase polyproteins and as a template for minus-strand synthesis. Members of the family Coronaviridae all seem to share two envelope protein species, the membrane (M) and spike (S) proteins. Similarities in size, predicted structures and presumed function(s) suggest a common ancestry, and the remote, but significant sequence similarities observed for toro-, bafini-, and (to lesser extent) coronavirus S proteins lend further support to this view.

The virions are enveloped and bacilliform in shape with rounded ends, where the envelope is studded with prominent peplomers projecting approximately 11 nm from the surface. The nucleocapsids are 20–30 nm in diameter and have a helical symmetry with coil periodicity of 5–7 nm. Long filamentous nucleocapsid precursors occur in the cytoplasm of infected cells and acquire envelopes by budding at endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The virions are sensitive to calcium hypochlorite and sodium dodecyl-sulfate, but sensitivity to other treatments is not known. The virions possess a lipid envelope derived from endoplasmic membranes of host cells. Compared to the genomes of vertebrate nidoviruses, the okavirus genome is unique in that the nucleoprotein gene (ORF2) is located upstream of the glycoprotein gene (ORF3), there is no discrete gene encoding a structural membrane (M) protein, and the virion envelope glycoproteins gp116 and gp64 are generated by proteolysis of a pp3 precursor polyprotein encoded by the ORF3 gene. Okaviruses have been detected only in crustaceans and their geographic range mirrors that of its primary penaeid host, extending across the Indo-Pacific from Eastern Africa, Southern and Southeast Asia, and Australia to islands in the South Pacific. Infections have also been detected recently in blue shrimp (P. stylirostris) from the Gulf of California, and they may be chronic or acute and transmitted horizontally or vertically.",2012-12-31,,Virus Taxonomy,,,True,custom_license

The virions of the Betatetravirus genus are nonenveloped, roughly spherical, of about 40 nm in diameter and exhibit T = 4 icosahedral shell quasi-symmetry. The genome consists of ssRNA and the viruses in the genus Betatetravirus have monopartite genomes. Betatetraviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and has three distinct types of genomic organization. Most of the members of the group are serologically interrelated but distinguishable. The majority of the isolates were identified on the basis of their serological reaction with antiserum raised against NβV. All the virus species were isolated from Lepidoptera species (moths and butterflies), principally from Saturniid, Limacodid, and Noctuid moths, and no replication in other animals has been detected. In larvae, virus replication is restricted predominantly to the cells of the midgut. With the exception of PrV, no infections by members of the Betatetravirus genus have been achieved in cultured cells, even when gRNA was transfected directly into cells. At high host densities, horizontal spread appears to be the major route of infection. Suggestive evidence exists for vertical transmission, which could be responsible for the observed persistence of tetraviruses within insect populations. The viruses replicate primarily in the cytoplasm of gut cells of several Lepidoptera species. The virons of omegatetravirus genus are nonenveloped, roughly spherical, about 40 nm in diameter and exhibit T = 4 icosahedral shell quasi-symmetry. Unlike viruses in the genus Betatetravirus, viruses in the genus Omegatetravirus have bipartite genomes. As with the betatetraviruses, omegatetraviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and studies in tissue culture cells show that the HaSV replicase is localized within the cytoplasm and associates with membranes derived from the endocytic pathway.",2012-12-31,,Virus Taxonomy,,,True,custom_license

Routine screening of foodstuffs for virus contamination is seldom performed, and may not be wholly cost-effective.

It could be wondered whether the other families of parasitoids are really absent, or if this is due to the fact that inadequate techniques were used to detect viruses. In fact, several different methods have been used: TEM of the venom glands of females, extraction of nucleic acids, followed by DNAse digestion to eliminate the polydnavirus or ascovirus genome, RT-PCR with primers specific of RdRp or data mining in an EST library. To resolve this problem of detecting RNA viruses, a systematic search for viruses in parasitoids should be carried out using a combination of these different methods. Only a few hymenopteran species are known to be infected by RNA viruses, although thousands of species are known to carry polydnaviruses or VLPs.

This will go beyond the generally accepted concept of antiviral resistance by summarizing those evolutionary outcomes that have enabled human viruses to resist mankind’s best efforts at control. The review then focuses on how viruses acquire resistance to compounds that specifically target a virus protein (e.g., polymerase, protease, integrase, sialidase). All viruses have a principle mechanism of acquiring resistance, random point mutations. Those viruses, which have segmented genomes, have an additional mechanism, genetic reassortment. For antiviral compounds that target a key virus enzyme, there is usually a stepwise evolution of resistance. For the therapy of chronic viral infections, such as HIV, the concept of increasing the genetic barrier has been important for optimizing drug combinations for effectively delaying the appearance of resistance. In some cases, the price to the virus for gaining resistance may be reduced “fitness” but there may also be other unexpected effects. Conceptually, one way to avoid virus resistance is to use a compound to target a host protein rather than a viral protein. Such an approach seems to risk causing unacceptable toxicity, however, some instances have been identified where there can be specificity for the virus-infected cell. We end by asking the question, how will viruses respond to such an indirect challenge?",2011-12-31,"Vere Hodge, Anthony; Field, Hugh J.",Genetics and Evolution of Infectious Disease,,,True,custom_license

The disease, originally termed “atypical pneumonia,” was first recognized in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China, which spread rapidly to 26 countries within 5 months and eventually led to 8096 human infection cases and 774 deaths. A previously unrecognized coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was later identified as the causative agent of the SARS. Subsequent investigation indicated that the source of the human infections was most likely originated from infected wildlife animals traded in the live animal markets, with masked palm civets being considered the most prominent and important carrier. Large-scale culling of civets appeared to have prevented further outbreaks in the region. Further epidemiological studies showed that civets are intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV, and bats are the likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and a large number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs). Detailed analysis of the massive SARS-CoV genomic sequence data accumulated indicated that SARS-CoV experienced a strong selection pressure during different outbreak phases in humans as well as interspecies transmission from animals to humans. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV plays a key role in virus–host interaction and hence is a key determinant of interspecies transmission. It has been shown that minor changes of amino acid (aa) residues in the S protein could lead to dramatic changes in virus susceptibility in animal and human hosts. This chapter will focus on the genetics and evolution of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs in humans, civets, and bats.

Several diseases are associated with EBV, including Hodgkin's and post-transplant lymphomas, oral hairy leukoplakia, and nasopharyngeal carcinomas. EBV has a double-stranded 172-kb DNA genome. Upon infection, the genome circularizes and persists as an episome in infected cells. More than 70 open reading frames exist, which encode proteins expressed during lytic and latent EBV infection. Lytic proteins encode viral proteins, which are necessary for the production of infectious virions, whereas latent proteins are needed to set up persistent infection by transforming and immortalizing host cells. EBV also encodes non-translated RNAs (e.g., EBER1 and EBER2), which are almost ubiquitously expressed and highly abundant in EBV-infected cells. Four EBV latency programs have been described with distinct sets of expressed proteins and viral RNAs: (1) Latency 0: EBER1 and EBER2 but no expression of proteins; (2) Latency 1 (true latency program): EBER1 and EBER2, EBNA1; (3) Latency 2 (default program): EBER1 and EBER2 and expression of EBNA1, latent membrane protein (LMP)-1, LMP2A, LMP2B; and (4) Latency 3 (growth program): EBER1 and EBER2 and expression of EBNA-leader protein (LP), EBNA 2–6, LMP1, LMP2A, LMP2B.

The chapter describes the diversity of virus genomes, and explains the major genetic mechanisms that affect viruses. The chemistry and structures of virus genomes are more varied than any of those seen in the entire bacterial, plant, or animal kingdoms. Virus genome structures and nucleotide sequences have been intensively studied in the recent decades because the power of recombinant DNA technology has focused a lot of attention in this area. The techniques of molecular biology have been a major influence on the virus genome. It is possible to separate the molecular analysis of virus genomes into two types of approaches: the physical analysis of structure and nucleotide sequence, and a more biological approach to examine the structure–function relationships of intact virus genomes and individual genetic elements. The chapter discusses virus genetics and its mutants, genetic and nongenetic interactions among viruses, small and large DNA genomes, positive and negative-strand RNA viruses, and segmented and multipartite virus genomes.

The virus replication involves three broad essential stages carried out by all types of viruses: the initiation of infection, replication and expression of the genome, and the release of mature virions from the infected cell. At a detailed level, there are many differences in the replication processes of different viruses that are imposed by the biology of the host cell and the nature of the virus genome. The other stages that have been discussed are: attachment, penetration, uncoating, genome replication, gene expression, assembly, maturation, and release. The chapter illustrates similarities in the pattern of replication of different viruses. Regardless of their hosts, all viruses must undergo each of these stages in some form to successfully complete their replication cycles.",2012-12-31,"Cann, Alan J.",Principles of Molecular Virology,,,True,custom_license

Like the course of a virus infection, pathogenesis is determined by the balance between host and virus factors. Not all the pathogenic symptoms seen in virus infections are caused directly by the virus but are side effects of the immune response. In the past few decades, molecular genetic analysis has contributed enormously in understanding the virus pathogenesis. In the chapter, three major aspects of virus pathogenesis are considered: direct cell damage resulting from virus replication, damage resulting from immune activation or suppression, and cell transformation caused by viruses. The chapter also discusses the mechanisms of cellular injury, virus-induced immunodeficiency, virus-related diseases, bacteriophages, and cell transformation by viruses, retroviruses, and DNA viruses. The chapter ends with a discussion of new pathogenic viruses that are being discovered all the time, and changes in human activities that have resulted in the emergence of new or previously unrecognized diseases.",2012-12-31,"Cann, Alan J.",Principles of Molecular Virology,,,True,custom_license

The incidence of foodborne diseases has been underreported and underestimated, and the asymptomatic presentation of some of the illnesses, worldwide heterogeneities in reporting, and the alternative transmission routes of certain pathogens are among the factors that contribute to this. Globalization, centralization of the food supply, transportation of food products progressively farther from their places of origin, and the multitude of steps where contamination may occur have made it increasingly challenging to investigate foodborne and waterborne outbreaks. Certain foodborne pathogens may be transmitted directly from animals to humans, while others are transmitted through vectors, such as insects, or through food handlers, contaminated food products or food-processing surfaces, or transfer from sponges, cloths, or utensils. Additionally, the airborne route may contribute to the transmission of certain foodborne pathogens. Complicating epidemiological investigations, multiple transmission routes have been described for some foodborne pathogens. Two types of transmission barriers, primary and secondary, have been described for foodborne pathogens, each of them providing opportunities for preventing and controlling outbreaks. Primary barriers, the most effective sites of prophylactic intervention, prevent pathogen entry into the environment, while secondary barriers prevent the multiplication and dissemination of pathogens that have already entered the environment. Understanding pathogen dynamics, monitoring transmission, and implementing preventive measures are complicated by the phenomenon of superspreading, which refers to the concept that, at the level of populations, a minority of hosts is responsible for the majority of transmission events.",2017-12-31,"Stein, R.A.; Chirilã, M.",Foodborne Diseases,,,True,custom_license

N-formyl peptides produced by Gram-negative bacteria were among the first chemotactic factors identified for two FPRs in human beings: FPR1 (originally termed FPR) and FPR2 (originally termed FPRL1). During the past few years, a variety of novel pathogen- and host-derived agonists as well as antagonists for the FPR family have been identified, indicating a broader spectrum of the biological significance of these receptors. Activation of FPRs in leukocytes by agonists induces cell chemotaxis, phagocytosis, release of proinflammatory mediators and gene transcription.

The first method employs the 3′-exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase (T4 pol), Taq DNA polymerase (Taq pol), and Taq DNA ligase (Taq lig) in a two-step thermocycled reaction. The second method uses 3′-exonuclease III (ExoIII), antibody-bound Taq pol, and Taq lig in a one-step thermocycled reaction.

Immune responses require the coordinated action of leukocytes that travel the body to eliminate threats posed by trauma, infection, toxins, and cancer. Leukocytes communicate via direct contact and via production and receipt of soluble proteins and intercellular messenger proteins called cytokines. Complete clearance of unwanted entities may involve both innate and adaptive leukocyte responses, which influence each other. Some innate mechanisms require no induction and are completely non-specific, whereas others are inducible and involve broad receptor-mediated recognition of a limited number of pathogen-associated or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs). Adaptive responses involve the selective activation of lymphocytes via engagement of their antigen receptors by a specific foreign antigen. The three major subsets of lymphocytes are T helper cells (Th), cytotoxic T cells (Tc) and B cells, which use distinct mechanisms to recognize antigen and carry out different effector functions.

Innate immunity mediated by neutrophils, NK cells, NKT cells, γδ T cells, complement and microbicidal molecules prevents infection or slows it until adaptive immunity can also respond to the pathogen. Extracellular entities are coated in antibody and cleared by antibody- and complement-mediated mechanisms. Parasitic worms are prevented from anchoring in the host by IgA and IgE antibodies. IgE triggers mast cell, basophil and eosinophil degranulation and the release of toxic mediators. Intracellular bacteria and parasites as well as viruses are eliminated by CTLs, NK cells, NKT cells and γδ T cells secreting cytotoxic cytokines and/or carrying out target cell cytolysis. Macrophage hyperactivation and granuloma formation may be triggered to confine persistent invaders. Th1 and Th17 responses support cell-mediated immunity against internal threats, whereas Th2 responses support humoral immunity against external threats.

SARS-CoV emerged in the human population in China in 2002, causing a worldwide epidemic with severe morbidity and high mortality rates, particularly in older individuals. We review the pathogenesis of both viruses and the several reverse genetics systems that made much of these studies possible.

The methods of detection include cultivation of bacteria and fungi on growth medium, isolation of viruses in cell culture, and identification of the agent biochemically, antigenically, or genetically. Infectious diseases can also be identified by detection of a specific immune response, usually antibodies, that develop during the course of illness. Visualization of an agent in infected tissue can provide a diagnosis based on specific morphological characteristics or identify the category of organism, for example, gram-positive or gram-negative bacterium or virus (e.g., eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in neurons in rabies virus infection). Methods that detect and allow visualization of antigens (immunohistochemistry) or nucleic acid sequences (in situ hybridization) provide more specific diagnoses. Detection of specific nucleic acid sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction is a powerful molecular diagnostic tool. Since the elucidation of the etiology of the first infectious disease, anthrax, more than 135 years ago, Koch's postulates have been applied and modified as novel technologies and agents have emerged.

The biopsy is generally taken through an endoscope, by either forceps or suction, from the duodenum or proximal jejunum. Depending upon the underlying condition, morphological abnormalities are seen in malabsorption range from normal mucosa with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (gluten-sensitive enteropathy, viral gastroenteritis, food allergies, etc.), villous shortening with crypt hyperplasia (celiac disease (CD), treated CD, tropical sprue, and bacterial overgrowth), to completely flat mucosa (CD, refractory sprue, enteropathy-induced T-cell lymphoma, and autoimmune enteropathy). Infectious agents that affect gastrointestinal tract can be grouped as food-borne and water-borne bacteria, opportunistic infections (bacterial, fungal, and viral), viral infections (extremely rarely biopsied), and parasitic and helminthic infections. The majority of these infections are, however, self-limited. Although biopsy is more invasive, the use of this procedure allows detection of other causes, including Whipple's disease, other protozoan forms of diarrhea (e.g., cryptosporidiosis, isosporiasis, or cyclosporiasis), Crohn's disease, or lymphoma that may also present as diarrhea and malabsorption.",2014-12-31,"Ensari, A.",Pathobiology of Human Disease,,,True,custom_license

Laboratories combine the use of traditional microscopy and culture methods, with a rapidly evolving set of molecular and proteomic techniques.

Current asthma management involves a step-up and step-down approach based on asthma control with a large degree of heterogeneity in responses to the main drug classes currently in use: β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, corticosteroids, and leukotriene modifiers. Importantly, asthma is heterogeneous with respect to clinical presentation and the inflammatory mechanisms that underlie it. This heterogeneity likely contributes to variable results in clinical trials, particularly when targeting specific inflammatory mediators. These factors have motivated a drive toward stratified medicine in asthma based on clinical/cellular outcomes or genetics (i.e., pharmacogenetics). Significant progress has been made in identifying genetic polymorphisms that influence the efficacy and potential for adverse effects of all main classes of asthma drugs. Importantly an emerging role for genetics in phase II development of newer therapies has been demonstrated (e.g., anti-IL4). Similarly, the stratification of patients based on clinical characteristics (e.g., blood and sputum eosinophil levels) has been critical in evaluating newer therapies (e.g., anti-IL5). As a proof of concept, anti-IgE is the latest therapy to be introduced into clinical practice, although only for severe, allergic patients (i.e., in a stratified manner). As new asthma genes are identified using genome-wide association, among other technologies, new targets (e.g., IL33/IL33 receptor (IL1RL1)) will emerge and pharmacogenetics in these development programs will be essential. In this chapter we review the current understanding of asthma pathobiology and its clinical presentation, as well as the use of stratified medicine, which holds great promise for maximizing clinical outcomes and minimizing adverse effects in existing and new therapies.",2014-12-31,"Shaw, Dominick; Portelli, Michael; Sayers, Ian",Handbook of Pharmacogenomics and Stratified Medicine,,,True,custom_license

They have been classified as category A pathogens by CDC (centers for disease control and prevention). Hantaviruses pose a serious threat to human health because their infection causes two highly fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These pathogens are transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of their infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have a tripartite-segmented negative-sense RNA genome. The three genomic RNA segments, S, M, and L, encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a precursor glycoprotein that is processed into two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. N protein is the major structural component of the virus, its main function is to protect and encapsidate the three genomic RNAs forming three viral ribonucleocapsids. Recent studies have proposed that N in conjunction with RdRp plays important roles in the transcription and replication of viral genome. In addition, N preferentially facilitates the translation of viral mRNA in cells. Glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, play major roles in viral attachment and entry to the host cells, virulence, and assembly and packaging of new virions in infected cells. RdRp functions as RNA replicase and transcriptase to replicate and transcribe the viral RNA and is also thought to have endonuclease activity. Currently, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available for the treatment of hantavirus-associated diseases. Understanding the molecular details of hantavirus life cycle will help in the identification of targets for antiviral therapeutics and in the design of potential antiviral drug for the treatment of HFRS and HCPS. Due to the alarming fatality of hantavirus diseases, development of an effective vaccine against hantaviruses is a necessity.",2011-12-31,"Hussein, Islam T.M.; Haseeb, Abdul; Haque, Absarul; Mir, Mohammad A.",Advances in Applied Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

The role of chemokines in rabies pathogenesis and protection has only recently been investigated. Expression of chemokines is induced by infection with laboratory-adapted, but not street, rabies viruses (RABVs), and it has been hypothesized that expression of chemokines is one of the mechanisms by which RABV is attenuated. To further define the role of chemokines in rabies pathogenesis and protection, chemokine genes such as MIP-1α, RANTES, IP-10, and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) have been cloned into RABV genome. It has been found that recombinant RABVs expressing RANTES or IP-10 induce high and persistent expression of these chemokines, resulting in massive infiltration of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS) and development of diseases and death in the mouse model. However, recombinant RABVs expressing MIP-1α, MDC, as well as GM-CSF further attenuate RABV by inducing a transient expression of chemokines, infiltration of inflammatory cells, enhancement of blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Yet, these recombinant RABVs show increased adaptive immune responses by recruiting/activating dendritic cells, T and B cells in the periphery as well as in the CNS. Further, direct administration of these recombinant RABVs into the CNS can prevent mice from developing rabies days after infection with street RABV. All these studies together suggest that chemokines are both protective and pathogenic in RABV infections. Those with protective roles could be exploited for development of future RABV vaccines or therapeutic agents.",2011-12-31,"Niu, Xuefeng; Wang, Hualei; Fu, Zhen F.",Advances in Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

The lack of reliable data and the short operating history of China as a semicapitalist country make firm conclusions difficult. However, overall the evidence points to further problems in the Chinese banking and real estate sectors. If this is true, then it is not too late to short Chinese banks and property stocks. Some investors predict that China's real estate bubble will soon burst as the property prices in China are relatively high with respect to GDP per capita and as the Chinese government took actions in April 2010 to regulate real estate prices. However, economic activities in China are controlled by central and municipal governments, sizable state-owned banks, and enterprises to a great extent. In 2010, the magnitude of bank lending has been reduced greatly following the change in monetary policy. This is expected to cool down the transaction volume of the real estate market. Even with the drop of property prices, the Chinese central government is taking measures to curb current real estate prices. A decline of 30% or more in real estate prices is widely accepted by the central government, but it is not certain that commercial banks can assume such big declines. Possibly a decline of over 50% in real estate prices is expected to induce a new wave of financial crisis in China. Therefore, a rapid drop in real estate prices is hazardous to the banking system and the government expects a slow decline. The Chinese government has recognized that a bubble currently exists and has opted to contain real estate prices to maintain a “harmonious society.”",2012-12-31,"Treadway, Peter T.; Michael C.S., Wong",Handbook of Short Selling,,,True,custom_license

To ensure the safety of new vaccines, preclinical toxicology studies are conducted prior to the initiation of, and concurrently with, clinical studies. There are five different types of preclinical toxicology study in the evaluation of vaccine safety: single and/or repeat dose, reproductive and developmental, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and safety pharmacology. If any adverse effects are observed in the course of these studies, they should be fully evaluated and a final safety decision made accordingly. Successful preclinical toxicology studies depend on multiple factors including: using the appropriate study designs, using the right animal model, and evoking an effective immune response.

Among the common strategies developed by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, helminths, and fungi is the manipulation of the regulatory T cell network in order to favor pathogen survival and transmission. Treg activity also benefits the host in many circumstances by controlling immunopathogenic reactions to infection. Interestingly, some pathogens are able to directly induce the conversion of naive T cells into suppressive Foxp3-expressing Tregs, while others activate pre-existing natural Tregs, in both cases repressing pathogen-specific effector responses. However, Tregs can also act to promote immunity in certain settings, such as in initial stages of infection when effector cells must access the site of infection, and subsequently in ensuring generation of effector memory. Notably, there is little current information on whether infections selectively drive pathogen-specific Tregs, and if so whether these cells are also reactive to self-antigens. Further analysis of specificity, together with a clearer picture of the relative dynamics of Treg subsets over the course of disease, should lead to rational strategies for immune intervention to optimize immunity and eliminate infection.",2011-12-31,"Maizels, Rick M.; Smith, Katherine A.",Advances in Immunology,,,True,custom_license

With the possibility of exposure to a variety of respiratory toxicants from airborne pollutants in our environment during the course of daily activities, in occupational settings, the use of aerosol sprays for household products, and the development of inhalant bronchial therapies, pulmonary toxicology has become an important subspecialty of toxicology. The lung is susceptible to injury following hematogenous exposure to toxicants. Susceptibility to injury and the type of response following exposure to air- or blood-borne toxicants is largely dependent on the physiochemical characteristics and concentration of the toxicant, duration of exposure, site/tissue specific sensitivity, and the integrity of the defense mechanisms of the lung. In this chapter, nonneoplastic and neoplastic spontaneous lesions and those that develop in the lungs of rats following exposure to toxicants by various routes, but primarily by inhalation, are discussed in detail which provides insight into our understanding of how human lungs respond to toxic chemicals. In addition, the gross and microscopic anatomy of the rat lung is also discussed some detail. Although inhalation is the primary route of exposure in experimental studies, in the past, many studies used intratracheal instillation or direct injection of known carcinogens into the lung. These experiments often resulted in the development of squamous cell carcinomas even though they are very rare as a naturally occurring neoplasm. Instillation of chemicals or particles into the trachea or pleura or direct injection into the lung results in lesions or responses that may not be as relevant to understanding the mechanism of pulmonary carcinogenesis as inhalation of materials under more normal conditions. There remain, however, many areas where our understanding of the response of the lung to toxic chemicals is incomplete.",2018-12-31,"Herbert, Ronald A.; Janardhan, Kyathanahalli S.; Pandiri, Arun R.; Cesta, Mark F.; Chen, Vivian; Miller, Rodney A.",Boorman's Pathology of the Rat,,,True,custom_license

Despite the increased understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of ARDS, the mortality remains unacceptably high, ranging from 34% to 64%. Hence, ARDS represents an unmet medical need with an urgency to develop effective pharmacotherapies. Several promising targets that have been identified as potential therapies for ARDS have been limited because of difficulty with delivery. In particular, delivery of peptides and proteins to the lung is an ongoing challenge. Nanobiotechnology and nanoscience are the basis of innovative techniques to deliver drugs targeted to the site of inflamed organs, such as the lungs. Nanoscale drug delivery systems have the ability to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmakodynamics of agents allowing an increase in the biodistribution of therapeutic agents to target organs, resulting in improved efficacy with reduction in drug toxicity. These systems are exploited for therapeutic purpose to carry the drug in the body in a controlled manner from the site of administration to the therapeutic target. Hence, it is an attractive strategy to test potential targets for ALI/ARDS using nanotechnology.

These safety considerations become even more important as technologies allowing the development of novel vaccine types are developed, such as DNA vaccines and those delivered in vector systems such as adenoviral vectors. The use of adjuvants other than the standard aluminum-based ones and novel delivery systems such as electrostimulation have also led to additional testing requirements.

A CSF analysis provides a general index of neurologic health, and it often provides evidence of the presence of disease. Similar to a complete blood count, CSF analysis has reasonable sensitivity but low specificity. The possible alterations of CSF are relatively limited compared to the varieties of neurologic diseases that exist. Additionally, the type and degree of CSF abnormality seems to be related as much to the location of disease as to the cause or the severity of the lesion; meningeal and paraventricular diseases generally produce greater abnormalities than deep parenchymal diseases. Previous therapy may affect the type, degree, and duration of CSF abnormalities as well. The CSF abnormalities identified upon analysis are also dependent on the CSF collection site with respect to lesion location.

Within the gastrointestinal tract, these substances are solubilized and degraded enzymatically to simple molecules, sufficiently small in size and in a form that permits absorption across the mucosal epithelium. The distribution of the different types of secretory cells in the salivary glands varies among species. The mandibular and sublingual glands are mixed salivary glands containing both mucous and serous types of cells, and produce a viscous secretion that contains large amounts of mucus. The cytoplasm of the secretory cells contains numerous zymogen granules that vary in size and number depending on the activity of the gland. These granules contain the precursors of the hydrolytic enzymes responsible for digestion of the major dietary components.

HP is a wide and complex domain: systems in this domain are large (in terms of size and scope) integrated (each subsystem cannot be considered as an isolated system) and different in purpose. Such systems require a multidisciplinary approach for their design and analysis and they are necessarily required to provide data and information fusion in the most general sense. The first data fusion algorithms employed in real systems in the radar field go back to the early seventies; now a days new concepts have been developed and spread to be applied to very complex systems with the aim to achieve the highest level of intelligence as possible and hopefully to support decision. Data fusion is aimed to enhance situation awareness and decision making through the combination of information/data obtained by networks of homogeneous and/or heterogeneous sensors. The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of the several approaches that can be followed to design and analyze systems for homeland protection. Different fusion architectures can be drawn on the basis of the employed algorithms: they are analyzed under several aspects in this chapter. Real study cases applied to real world problems of homeland protection are provided in the chapter.,2014-12-31,"Farina, Alfonso; Ortenzi, Luciana; Ristic, Branko; Skvortsov, Alex",Academic Press Library in Signal Processing,,,True,custom_license

Coupled with the emerging biological and pathological significance of carbohydrates, lectins have become extensively used as research tools in glycobiology. However, lectin-based drug development has been impeded by high manufacturing costs, low chemical stability, and the potential risk of initiating an unfavorable immune response. As alternatives to lectins, non-protein small molecules having carbohydrate-binding properties (lectin mimics) are currently attracting a great deal of attention because of their ease of preparation and chemical modification. Lectin mimics of synthetic origin are divided roughly into two groups, boronic acid-dependent and boronic acid-independent lectin mimics. This article outlines their representative architectures and carbohydrate-binding properties, and discusses their therapeutic potential by reviewing recent attempts to develop antiviral and antimicrobial agents using their architectures. We also focus on the naturally occurring lectin mimics, pradimicins and benanomicins.

Mycotoxins and stress, often caused by poor management practices, can also cause immunosuppression. The effects on the innate and acquired immune responses and the mechanisms by which mycotoxins, stress and infectious agents cause immunosuppression are discussed. Immunoevasion is a common ploy by which viruses neutralize or evade immune responses. DNA viruses such as herpesvirus and poxvirus have multiple genes, some of them host-derived, which interfere with effective innate or acquired immune responses.

Immunological responses against sperm antigens or other elements of the reproductive tract can lead to androgen insufficiency, infertility, or chronic inflammation. Systemic or local immune activation and inflammation directly inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-Leydig cell axis, interfere with spermatogenic cell development, and may provoke sperm antibody formation. Traditional explanations for protection of spermatogenic cells, based on physical barriers or immune cell exclusion, are not consistent with either the organization of the reproductive tract or modern concepts of immunoregulation. Regulation of immune responses in the male reproductive tract involves immunoregulatory macrophages and lymphocytes, as well as active somatic cell suppression of antigen-specific immunity by anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive factors, including cytokines and androgenic steroids. These restraints on antigen-specific immune mechanisms appear to be counterbalanced by enhanced innate immunity. Finally, inflammatory signaling pathways appear to play an important role in normal male reproductive function, and there is evidence that establishment of male reproduction during development is intimately linked to the maturation of the local immune environment.",2015-12-31,"Hedger, Mark P.",Knobil and Neill's Physiology of Reproduction,,,True,custom_license

At one level, China is a one-party state that has been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party since 1949. In the late 1950s, the same authoritarian regime was waging a massive campaign under the name of the ‘Great Leap Forward’, which resulted in the loss of a large number of lives. From 1966 to 1976, the same regime was launching a so-called ‘Great Cultural Revolution’, causing serious cultural and economic damages to this nation. Furthermore, influential theories of the political economy of the former socialist systems emphasize that unless the one-party monopoly is abolished, reforms are doomed to fail. Obviously, the achievements of China’s modernization defy conventional explanations. Consequently, this will lead to the asking of questions such as: How has the Chinese political system worked during the past decades? Can it be sustained in the long run?

There have been different names for the greater China area, such as ‘the Chinese circle’, ‘the Chinese community’, ‘the greater China community’, ‘China economic circle’, ‘Chinese economic area’, ‘China economic zone’, and so on. Probably first used by George Cressey at least as far back as the 1930s, the term ‘Greater China’ was to refer to the entire Chinese empire, as opposed to China proper (Harding, 1993, p. 660). The term ‘Greater China’ is now generally used for referring to the cultural and economic ties between the relevant territories, and is not intended to imply sovereignty. Sometimes, to avoid any political connotation, the term Chinese-speaking world is often used instead of the Greater China. Despite the common historical, cultural, and linguistic homogeneity, the greater China economic area has followed different routes of economic developments. Hong Kong and Macau have been under the colonial administrations of the UK and of Portugal, respectively. Taiwan was a Japanese colony between 1895 and 1945 and, following a short period of reunification with mainland China, has been operating independently from the rest of the world. As a result, significant social and economic differences have been present in the four parts of the area, especially since 1949. The Taiwan Strait became a forbidden boundary in 1949 when the Nationalist-led government fled to Taiwan and, at the same time, the Communist-led government was founded on the mainland. Since then, Taiwan and mainland China have been two divergent regimes. Against the common cultural and linguistic homogeneity, mainland China chose essentially to pursue a socialist line, while Taiwan followed the route of market-oriented capitalism. Furthermore, the two sides have also treated each other antagonistically, particularly during the high tide of military confrontation, when the mainland claimed that it would liberate the Taiwan compatriots from the black society sooner or later, while in turn Taiwan maintained that they would use the ‘three democratisms’ to reoccupy the mainland eventually. The Chinese people have a long history of migrating overseas. One of the migrations dates back to the Ming dynasty when Zheng He (1371–1435) became the envoy of the Ming emperor. He sent people – many of them Cantonese and Hokkien – to explore and trade in the South China Sea and in the Indian Ocean. Different waves of immigration led to subgroups among overseas Chinese such as the new and old immigrants in Southeast Asia, North America, Oceania, the Caribbean, Latin America, South Africa, and Russia. From the mid-nineteenth century onward, emigration has been directed primarily to Western countries (such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and Western Europe). Many of these emigrants were themselves overseas Chinese or were from Taiwan or Hong Kong, particularly from the 1950s to the 1970s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America, and the other parts of the world. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 further accelerated the migration. The wave calmed after Hong Kong’s transfer of sovereignty in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.

This final chapter will attempt to bring together a number of the common themes raised by these examples. These include the role of historical events in shaping the emergence of viruses in the present, the ability to retrospectively test samples to trace the emergence of disease and the technologies used to detect viruses. Technologies such as the polymerase chain reaction and mass sequencing have revolutionized virus detection and enabled the rapid identification and characterization of viruses. The application of these methods has led to the identification of new groups of viruses in samples obtained from a range of animal species without the need for invasive sampling or the recovery of live virus. However, with the detection of such a large range of viruses that exist asymptomatically with other species, the challenge now becomes the identification of those with the potential to become pathogenic for humans.",2014-12-31,"Wakeley, Philip R.; North, Sarah; Johnson, Nicholas",The Role of Animals in Emerging Viral Diseases,,,True,custom_license

In infected cells they induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), which are thought to be the site of virus replication. Until recently, both the origin of the CoV-induced vesicles and the exact localization of CoV replication remained unknown. It was assumed that the vesicles derive from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Nevertheless no conventional protein markers of the ER, ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), Golgi, or coatomer proteins could be detected in these structures. Recent data from our laboratory and others shed light on this mystery. It appears that the Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a prototype CoV, co-opts ERAD tuning vesicles as replication platforms. These vesicles are released from the ER, but do not contain conventional ER markers or coatomer proteins. Rather, they contain ERAD factors such as SEL1L, EDEM1, and OS-9 that are constitutively cleared from the folding compartment by so called ERAD tuning programs, and display non-lipidated LC3 (LC3-I) periferically associated at their limiting membrane. In MHV-infected cells, the ERAD tuning vesicle markers co-localize with viral non-structural proteins and double-stranded RNA, which are DMV markers. The unconventional role of LC3-I in the MHV infection cycle is further supported by the fact that Atg5 and Atg7, both essential proteins for LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and macroautophagy, are dispensable for CoV replication and DMV formation. These new insights into CoV replication might lead to new therapies to treat CoV infections. They also reveal a novel role for LC3, in its non-lipidated form, in both maintenance of cellular proteostasis and viral infection, the latter function supported by recent findings showing involvement of LC3-I in equine arteritis virus replication.",2014-12-31,"Noack, Julia; Bernasconi, Riccardo; Molinari, Maurizio","Autophagy: Cancer, Other Pathologies, Inflammation, Immunity, Infection, and Aging",,,True,custom_license

Governments too, since some diseases’ high prevalence affect the economic output of society. Yet the decisions as to which drugs will be developed are strictly in private hands. The risks required to treat some really important, and often increasingly prevalent, diseases mean that the desires of society and the industry are diverging. This is not boding well for our society. The understanding and willingness of governments to step in as a partner and financier is not apparent. Will governments recognize their role in this? Since the economic cost of these diseases, in terms of reduced productivity and medical costs to treat the disease, is enormous, understanding should be forthcoming. Government has invested for many decades in an enormous program of cancer research, which now shows dividends. The importance of further government investment in basic research is apparent when industry does not want to or cannot anymore afford it. As Big Pharma drops out of important therapeutic areas, it is not promising to assume that government can step in to the vacancy. There has to be a serious effort to find a formula by which the government gently or not so gently forces the industry to continue its efforts because it is so important. Perhaps the most important of these neglected diseases is Alzheimer’s disease (AD) because of its dehumanizing nature and its predictably massively increasing prevalence. Yet, none of the currently approved Alzheimer drugs can be used to prevent, cure, or even significantly slow the progression of this disease. It is predicted that by 2030 50% of the over 80s will have the disease. Almost 100% of people with an inheritable trait will develop the disease unless we succeed in finding a preventive therapy. Only recently has a preventive trial been announced. It is often thought that insulin-dependent diabetes is a well-treated disease and needs no further diagnostic and drug development efforts. This could not be further from the truth. The long-term complications of insulin-treated diabetes add to the economic burden, especially as the growth in prevalence of the disease expands with the waistlines of the world’s population. Three hundred million may have type 2 diabetes by 2030. Pharmaceutical control of weight loss has so far been vexed by serious side effects. When it comes to diabetes drugs, we start to recognize that the control of blood glucose can be further improved; the biggest contribution is not by drugs, but by self-diagnosis with point of care glucose measuring devices. Morphine is still the most effective medicine against pain. It has been around for 5,000 years and we haven’t come up with anything better. But it can be ineffective against neuropathic pain and cancer pain. New pain medicines are difficult to find because of the subjective measurement and poor animal models. Since many current pain killers are abused, there are other hurdles. Despite the many difficulties, society needs new pain killers at the same time that notable pharma are pulling out, despite the economic opportunity. Drugs against cancer have had many high-profile and expensive failures in recent years, with all major companies having at least one failed candidate. Biotech companies have made much progress, however, and they are either collaborating with or being taken over by Big Pharma. Oncology drug development has been crucially enabled by decades of government investment. The key is the many characterized drug targets that other disease areas do not have. Government intervention in oncology and HIV provide the model for treatment of AD, neuropathic pain, and schizophrenia, among other therapeutic areas.

Recent developments in the health status of the population are characterized by continuous improvement in life expectancy, chronic diseases which absorb 90% of total health care expenditure, differences in the causes of mortality (more than 70% mortality from cancer, heart and brain, and external causes). The new trends in health indicators define the current health policies and lead to the necessity of adapting the health system so as to meet the changing health needs of the population. Especially in the context of the changes in the epidemiological spectrum and the variability in the indices of morbidity and mortality, the focus is not only to further prolong life expectancy but also to improve life expectancy without chronic diseases and without disabilities and to reduce the avoidable mortality, the potential years of life lost before the age of 65years. According to this approach, the main strategic priorities of health policy in the European Union for the period 2014–2020 are: (1) Prevention and health promotion (to combat diseases associated with the modern way of life), (2) Protection from cross-border threats (to address the external impact from cross-border relations, combating epidemics, pandemics), (3) Viability (to address the lack of resources by adopting innovation), (4) Accessibility (to assure the access to medical expertise).Therefore, the key priorities are the prevention of disease and the improvement of life in good health, the patient safety and quality of health services, and the readiness to manage crises and health risks.",2015-12-31,"Soulis, Sotiris; Sarris, Marcos; Pierrakos, George; Goula, Aspasia; Koutitsas, George; Gkioka, Vasiliki",Cord Blood Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine,,,True,custom_license

Globally, the Norway rat has largely displaced the black rat, probably because of the Norway rat’s larger size and aggressiveness. The domestication and introduction of the albino R. norvegicus is rooted by its use in Europe and America in the 1800s as prey for a sport (rat baiting) in which individuals would wager on which terrier dog would most swiftly kill the largest number of rats confined to a pit. Because of the large numbers of rats needed for this sport, wild rats were purpose-bred, and albinos were selected out by some people as a hobby (Robinson, 1965; Mayhew, 1851).",2015-12-31,"Otto, Glen M.; Franklin, Craig L.; Clifford, Charles B.",Laboratory Animal Medicine,,,True,custom_license

During the first half of the 20th century, microbiological quality control of lab animals was at best rudimentary as colonies were conventionally housed and little or no diagnostic testing was done. Hence, animal studies were often curtailed and confounded by infectious disease (Mobraaten and Sharp, 1999; Morse, 2007; Weisbroth, 1999). By the 1950s, it became apparent to veterinarians in the nascent field of comparative medicine that disease-free animals suitable for research could not be produced by standard veterinary disease control measures (e.g., improved sanitation and nutrition, antimicrobial treatments) in conventional facilities. Henry Foster, the veterinarian who founded Charles River Breeding Laboratories in 1948 and a pioneer in the large-scale production of laboratory rodents, stated in a seminar presented at the 30th anniversary of AALAS, “After a variety of frustrating health-related problems, it was decided that a major change in the company’s philosophy was required and an entirely different approach was essential”. Consequently, he and others developed innovative biosecurity systems to eliminate and exclude pathogens (Allen, 1999). In 1958, Foster reported on the Cesarean-originated barrier-sustained (COBS) process for the large-scale production of specific pathogen-free (SPF) laboratory rodents (Foster, 1958). To eliminate horizontally transmitted pathogens, a hysterectomy was performed on a near-term dam from a contaminated or conventionally housed colony. The gravid uterus was pulled through a disinfectant solution into a sterile flexible film isolator where the pups were removed from the uterus and suckled on axenic (i.e., germ-free) foster dams. After being mated to expand their number and associated with a cocktail of nonpathogenic bacteria to normalize their physiology and prime their immune system, rederived rodents were transferred to so-called barrier rooms for large-scale production. The room-level barrier to adventitious infection entailed disinfection of the room, equipment, and supplies, limiting access to trained and properly gowned personnel, and the application of new technologies such as high-efficiency particulate air-filtration of incoming air (Dubos and Schaedler, 1960; Foster, 1980; Schaedler and Orcutt, 1983; Trexler and Orcutt, 1999). The axenic and associated rodents mentioned in the COBS process are collectively classified as gnotobiotic to indicate that they have a completely known microflora. By contrast, barrier-reared rodent colonies are not gnotobiotic because they are housed in uncovered cages and thus acquire a complex microflora from the environment, supplies, personnel, and other sources. Instead, they are described as SPF to indicate that according to laboratory testing, they are free from infection with a defined list of infectious agents, commonly known as an ‘exclusion’ list.",2015-12-31,"Shek, William R.; Smith, Abigail L.; Pritchett-Corning, Kathleen R.",Laboratory Animal Medicine,,,True,custom_license

Ironically, it is the success of the field that has led to a renewed interest in xenotransplantation during the past several decades. To a large part, this has occurred because of the great scarcity of human organ and tissue donors. However, it has expanded to include the use of cells from animals into humans such as porcine islet cells for diabetes or extracorporeal perfusion of human blood through animal organs or cells. Similar to allotransplantation, issues regarding transmission of infections from the graft to the human recipient were brought up for consideration with these procedures in the 1990s (Michaels and Simmons, 1994; Chapman et al., 1995; Hammel et al., 1998; Fishman et al., 1998). A risk for infection exists with the use of any biologic agent regardless of whether it is from a human or an animal source. Accordingly, transmission of infections from human organs, tissues, or cells is a well-recognized cause of disease after allotransplantation (Ison and Grossi, 2013; Green and Michaels, 2012). As the human graft shortage continues, newer cellular therapies are explored. Thus, attention continues to be given to the potential use of xenogeneic organs, tissues, or cells for human maladies through xenotransplantation. The potential for novel zoonotic infections to emerge because of xenotransplantation (xenozoonoses or xenosis) led to a debate on whether the field should be permitted to progress. This chapter reviews the issues of xenotransplantation related to infections from animals to humans. Lessons learned from infections with prior nonhuman primate xenotransplantation and human allotransplantation are used to help inform about risks with newer xenogeneic procedures. In addition, information on known zoonoses is reviewed to better develop constructs to decrease the hazard of infection with these novel procedures.",2015-12-31,"Michaels, Marian G.",Laboratory Animal Medicine,,,True,custom_license

In this context, there has been some controversy regarding the appropriate way to define invasive species and the invasion process, given the widespread use of these terms in both scientific and nonscientific frameworks. Although scientists have not unambiguously identified tax-independent characteristics that define all invasive species, the invasion process itself has been observed to progress through the same sequence of stages regardless of taxonomic identity (i.e., initial establishment, expansion, and saturation). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment and spread of non-indigenous species in new environments. In the scenario of global change, species introductions and invasions are a major topic due to ecological impacts (e.g., changes in biodiversity), economic and social impacts (e.g., costs incurred for control or eradication or pests) and human health impacts (e.g., epidemics or increased exposure to hazards). Current research highlights the introduction and spread of non-indigenous species as both a consequence and cause of global change with repercussions on ecosystems, economies, and human societies.",2019-12-31,"Neill, P.E.; Arim, M.",Encyclopedia of Environmental Health,,,True,custom_license

The world-population growth curve is an exponential curve. What do plant growth curves look like? Because water is the most important soil physical factor affecting plant growth, it is important to quantify plant growth to determine effects of water stress. In any experimental dealing with plant–water relations, some measure of plant growth (e.g., height, biomass) should be obtained. Plant growth curves also exemplify quantitative relationships. The chapter seeks to understand basic principles of plant–water relations. If equations can be developed to show relationships, then one can predict what is going to happen. Equations describing plant-growth curves demonstrate how one can quantify, and thus predict, plant growth. The chapter first considers the growth of the bacterium Escherichia coli. In the early nineteenth century, when plants and animals were being classified, the bacteria were arbitrarily included in the plant kingdom, and botanists first studied them. Even though bacteria are not plants or animals, we can follow their growth to understand plant growth curves.",2005-12-31,"Kirkham, M.B.",Principles of Soil and Plant Water Relations,,,True,custom_license

The problems of the infections are exacerbated by rapid transmission of the pathogenic agents, which occur through inhalation and direct contact with contaminated surfaces. Moreover, cross-species transmission resulting from changes to viral genetic makeup poses a risk for emergence of pathogens with new characteristics, which in some cases may be responsible for causing different diseases. With the advent of efficient sequencing and nucleic acid-based virus-disabling technologies, gene therapy is well placed to advance new treatments to counter respiratory infections. Most studies aimed at using nucleic acids to treat respiratory viral infections have used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence viral gene targets. A few studies have used silencing of host factors required by the viruses as a means of inhibiting viral replication and preventing emergence of escape mutants. By administering antivirals to the airways, studies performed in vivo have taken advantage of the anatomy of the respiratory system to deliver therapeutic nucleic acids. Reported data have shown proof of principle of efficacy of gene therapy in models of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, influenza virus A, and measles virus, among others. RNAi-based gene therapy has been advanced to clinical trial for treatment of RSV infection. Although the primary endpoint was not met in an intent-to-treat analysis, the investigation has provided useful information for the advancement of gene therapy for current and emergent respiratory infections.",2015-12-31,"Arbuthnot, Patrick",Gene Therapy for Viral Infections,,,True,custom_license

Popular targets for this therapy have been sequences encoding viral proteins and cellular host factors on which viruses depend for their replication. Therefore, availability of technologies that inactivate genes specifically, safely and effectively is crucial. Hence, discovery of RNA interference and advances in gene editing methods have been particularly important to the field. Gene transfer to induce prophylactic and therapeutic immunostimulation is also being developed to manage viral infections. Although promising, progress and ultimate success of antiviral gene therapy is dependent on several factors. These include overcoming problems that are generic to the field and influences of elements that are particular to specific viral infections. Viral and nonviral vectors (NVVs) have been used to deliver antiviral sequences, and both have advantages and drawbacks. Viral vectors are suited to delivering DNA-based expression cassettes, including immunostimulatory and virus-targeting sequences, whereas NVVs may be better applied to carrying therapeutic RNAs such as synthetic short interfering RNAs or mRNAs. Nonviral formulations are appealing because they cause limited immunostimulation, obviate mutagenic effects of DNA, and are amenable to easier dose control and large-scale synthesis. To date, encouraging results have been obtained in preclinical and clinical assessments of gene therapy against HIV-1, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and Ebola viruses, among others. In the long term, widespread application of antiviral gene therapy will be dependent on the technology demonstrating good efficacy and advantages over other antiviral strategies.

Drugs that combat viral infections are called antiviral drugs. There are no effective antiviral drugs for many viral infections.

The arsenal of antivirals is complex. As of March 2014, it consists of approximately 50 drugs approved by the FDA, approximately half of which are directed against HIV. Antiviral drug creation strategies are focused on two different approaches: targeting the viruses themselves or targeting host cell factors. Direct virus-targeting antiviral drugs include attachment inhibitors, entry inhibitors, uncoating inhibitors, protease inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors. Protease inhibitors (darunavir, atazanavir, and ritonavir), viral DNA polymerase inhibitors (acyclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, and tenofovir), and an integrase inhibitor (raltegravir) are included in the list of Top 200 Drugs by sales for the 2010s.",2016-12-31,"Vardanyan, Ruben; Hruby, Victor",Synthesis of Best-Seller Drugs,,,True,custom_license

Host epithelial cells are specially enriched for pattern recognition receptors that activate immune response genes to limit viral replication. A prominently expressed set of these genes encodes cytokines that orchestrate key aspects of host defense, such as recruitment of immune cells and repair of epithelial cell damage. Under some circumstances, airway epithelial cells may be programmed to release cytokines (notably IL-33) that activate a type 2 immune response, which in excess might contribute to the development of chronic obstructive lung disease. Moreover, long-term epithelial progenitor cells with this capability may explain an ongoing susceptibility to lung disease in response to acute respiratory infection or other types of inhaled danger signals. The mucosal airway epithelial cell can thereby mediate a beneficial response for host defense and a detrimental response leading to inflammatory disease.",2015-12-31,"Alexander-Brett, Jennifer; Holtzman, Michael J.",Mucosal Immunology,,,True,custom_license

The main viruses responsible for acute respiratory infection in people include respiratory syncytial, influenza, human parainfluenza, human metapneumo-, human rhino-, corona-, and adenoviruses. Licensed vaccines are available only for influenza virus, with vaccines against the other pathogens either in clinical trials or in preclinical stages of development. The majority of studies evaluating respiratory virus vaccines measure serum antibody responses, because, although both cellular and humoral responses contribute to the clearance of a primary infection, neutralizing antibodies are known to protect against secondary infection. Humoral responses can be readily detected after vaccination with inactivated or subunit vaccines; however, fewer individuals seroconvert after vaccination with live vaccines. Alternative immune mechanisms such as mucosal antibody responses are probably responsible for protection by live attenuated vaccines, and immune correlates of protection are under investigation.",2015-12-31,"Broadbent, Andrew J.; Boonnak, Kobporn; Subbarao, Kanta",Mucosal Immunology,,,True,custom_license

The first plant-based vaccines were expressed in stably transgenic plants, with the idea to conveniently deliver “edible vaccines” by ingestion of the antigen-containing plant material. These systems provided a proof of concept that oral delivery of vaccines in crude plant material could stimulate antigen-specific serum and mucosal antibodies. Transgenic grains like rice in particular provide a stable and robust vehicle for antigen delivery. However, some issues exist with stably transgenic plants, including relatively low expression levels and regulatory issues. Thus, many recent studies use transient expression with plant viral vectors to achieve rapid high expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, followed by purification of antigen and intranasal delivery for effective stimulation of mucosal immune responses.",2015-12-31,"Mason, Hugh S.; Thuenemann, Eva; Kiyono, Hiroshi; Kessans, Sarah; Matoba, Nobuyuki; Mor, Tsafrir",Mucosal Immunology,,,True,custom_license

Vaccines are used extensively in veterinary medicine, and innovative vaccine technologies such as recombinant DNA-vectored and distinguishing infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) vaccines and automated in ovo vaccination (of embryonated chicken eggs) have been rapidly adopted commercially. Immunological research using outbred, nonrodent animal models has contributed to a broader understanding of mucosal defenses, and has provided the initial impetus for investigation of the common mucosal immune system. Studies of the potential of novel adjuvants to improve vaccine efficacy against genetically unstable, immune-subverting RNA viruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in pigs, should assist in the control of pathogens with similar characteristics in other species. Successful development of vaccines to prevent and treat ascending infections of the reproductive tract of cattle set a precedent for applications in other species including humans.

Passive immunity provides immediate but short-lived protection, lasting several weeks up to 3 or 4 months. Passive immunity can occur naturally, when maternal antibodies are transferred to the fetus through the placenta or from breast milk to the gut of the infant. It can also be produced artificially, when antibody preparations derived from sera or secretions of immunized donors or, more recently, different antibody producing platforms are transferred via systemic or mucosal route to nonimmune individuals. Passive immunization has recently become an attractive approach because of the emergence of new and drug-resistant microorganisms, diseases that are unresponsive to drug therapy and individuals with an impaired immune system who are unable to respond to conventional vaccines. This chapter addresses the contributions of natural and artificial acquired passive immunity in understanding the concept of passive immunization.

The MG is not an inductive site for mucosal immunity. Rather, synthesis of immunoglobulin (Ig)A by plasma cells stimulated at distal inductive sites dominate in the milk of rodents, humans, and swine whereas IgG1 derived from serum predominates in ruminants. Despite the considerable biodiversity in the role of the MG, IgG passively transfers the maternal systemic immunological experience whereas IgA transfers the mucosal immunological experience. Although passive antibodies are protective, they and other lacteal constituents can be immunoregulatory. Immune protection of the MG largely depends on the innate immune system; the monocytes–macrophages group together with intraepithelial lymphocytes is dominant in the healthy gland. An increase in somatic cells (neutrophils) and various interleukins signal infection (mastitis) and a local immune response in the MG.

Positive sense RNA can be translated directly into protein, without a DNA intermediate and without creating a complementary RNA strand. To replicate its genome, though, a complementary DNA strand is required. The positive RNA strand serves as a template for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, yielding a complementary RNA strand, to form a dimer with the template strand. The double-stranded RNA subsequently serves as the template for a new positive sense genome. The positive strand RNA genome is independently infectious, for most Group IV viruses. This means that in the absence of a capsid, envelope, or enclosed proteins, the RNA molecule, when inserted into a cell, is capable of using host cell machinery to construct additional viruses. There are six subclasses of the Group IV single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses: Picornaviridae, Togaviridae, Coronaviridae, Hepeviridae, Caliciviridae, Flaviviridae, and Astroviridae. As expected, within each class, viruses share structural similarities; but there are no properties, other than the defining property of a (+)-sense single stranded RNA genome, that extends to all six classes of the Group IV viruses.

This chapter discusses various nonparenteral routes of administration. The oral route of administration is the most preferred and patient compliant method of them all. Transdermal, buccal, and pulmonary routes are also discussed. We have developed novel technologies using nanoparticles and microparticles to deliver vaccines by the oral and transdermal route of administration. These new technologies enable the formulation of vaccine particles containing vaccine antigens, without loss of their biological activity during the formulation process. Also, multiple antigens, targeting ligands and adjuvants can all be encapsulated within the same particle. When administered orally, these particles are designed to withstand the acidic environment of the stomach and are targeted to the Peyer’s patches and the gut-associated mucosal immune system. Because these vaccines are particulate in nature, they are readily taken up by phagocytic antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as M cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages in the Peyer’s patches of the intestines, resulting in a strong immune response and antibody production. Of particular interest is the fact that the particles release the antigen in a slow and sustained manner over a prolonged time period, intracellularly into APCs, resulting in strong mucosal and systemic immunity after oral administration, without the need for added adjuvants that are typically present in current vaccine preparations. Because no needles are required for oral vaccines, this method of vaccine delivery is inexpensive and suitable for mass vaccination in the developing world as well as for the developed world. This chapter discusses studies conducted on a wide array of vaccines, including infectious disease vaccines and cancer vaccines. This method of vaccine delivery enables the delivery of a wide spectrum of vaccines for prophylactic and therapeutic use, including oral and transdermal vaccines for cancer such as human papillomavirus, melanoma, ovarian, breast, and prostate with encouraging results.

In spite of the high specificity of the viral proteinases, cellular substrates for animal virus proteinases have been described in this chapter. The activity of the viral proteinases can interfere with important cellular processes to favor virus replication. The recent use of proteinase inhibitors in AIDS therapy has emphasized the convenience of virus-encoded proteinases as targets of antiviral action. A mutant protein able to inhibit the activity of the TEV proteinase by manipulation of the α2-macroglobulin bait region was designed by Van Rompaey.",1999-12-31,"García, Juan Antonio; Fernández-Fernández, María Rosario; López-Moya, Juan José",Proteases of Infectious Agents,,,True,custom_license

This chapter concentrates on the pathology of the more common pathogens of the laboratory rat. Based on serologic surveys, parvo viruses are some of the most common viral pathogens in wild and laboratory rat. In general, there are three main serogroups, including Rat virus (RV), H-1 virus, and Ratparvovirus (RPV). Both RPV and RV are tropic for many of the same tissues and they both may result in a persistent infection. However, RPV is antigenically and genetically distinct from RV, and it apparently does not cause clinical signs or lesions in infant rats. M. pulmonis causes natural disease in rats and mice. The infection in young rats is usually clinically silent. In older rats, there are nonspecific clinical signs such as snuffling, chromodacryorrhea, and face and ear rubbing. Several bacteria of the genus Streptococcus can cause clinical disease in rats. All of the streptococci of concern in rats are Gram-positive cocci, and are catalase-negative, nonfermentative, and generally nonmotile. Cilia-associated respiratory bacillus has been identified in rats. In rats, infection is usually asymptomatic although nonspecific clinical signs, such as weight loss and dyspnea, may be observed.",2000-12-31,"Gaillard, Elias T; Clifford, Charles B",The Laboratory Rat,,,True,custom_license

It is for this reason that so-called (specific pathogen free) SPF animals are used for animal experiments. Certain requirements are necessary to maintain the desired SPF organism. Physical barriers together with appropriate operating methods aim at preventing contamination with pathogens and penetration by wild rodents. As a consequence, barrier units are not easily accessible for personnel, which is sometimes considered a disadvantage by experimenters. Finally, monitoring programs help to detect and control potential sources of contamination and may therefore be of crucial importance for the management of a facility housing animals of a good microbiological quality. The main purpose of health monitoring is to detect or prevent infections, which might influence physiological characteristics of animals or their health. Appropriate health monitoring helps to avoid imprecise results and allows all the experiments necessary to be carried out with a minimum number of animal. It is found that sufficient number of animals have to be monitored to obtain relevant information on a given population. It is important that the monitoring must be performed on a regular basis to detect unwanted microorganisms in good time. The recommended frequency is every 12 week.",2000-12-31,"Kunstyr, Ivo; Nicklas, Werner",The Laboratory Rat,,,True,custom_license

Culture of cells in monolayers is the most common method used in diagnostic virology laboratories. Primary or secondary cultures cells retain their diploid chromosome number, a factor which makes them particularly susceptible to certain viruses. The ideal cell system for a diagnostic virology laboratory would be a continuous line which retained its diploid chromosome number. It would be impossible in a routine laboratory to inoculate each specimen into every type of cell culture. A routine procedure is therefore employed and the specimen is inoculated into three types of cells which will support the growth of as many viruses as possible. Mixed culture technique (cocultivation) has proved of value when a viral agent is difficult to isolate from the original tissue, for example, isolation of measles from a brain biopsy. Cultures of chopped tissues have been used for many years to support the growth of viruses but the techniques were not readily applicable to diagnostic virology. A simple method of cultivating fragments of ciliated epithelium was described, which resulted in the isolation of new rhinoviruses and a new member of the corona virus group.",1973-12-31,"Moffat, Margaret A.J.",Tissue Culture,,,False,custom_license

These three diseases have very different clinical courses and distinctive pathological features, although all share the essential element of demyelination. ADEM and PML have antithetic modes of pathogenesis. ADEM is a predominantly extraneural infection resulting in a virus-induced host autoimmune response, whereas PML is a direct lytic infection of oligodendrocytes in an immunocompromised host. It is clear that a diverse array of viruses can infect the human central nervous system. The viral infections can result in a wide variety of clinical and pathological symptoms. While some viruses may cause widespread inflammation and neurodegeneration, other viruses may remain latent in the CNS and only produce pathological changes during reactivation. Viral induced demyelination can occur both from direct infection of the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, as in PML, or by indirect mechanisms that have yet to be determined. The outcome of a viral CNS infection depends not only on viral characteristics, but also on the interaction between virus and host cell.",2004-12-31,"Johnson, Richard T.; Major, Eugene O.",Myelin Biology and Disorders,,,True,custom_license

These are Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus and murine hepatitis virus. Both viruses produce acute inflammatory encephalitis that is followed by chronic central-nervous-system (CNS) demyelinating disease. The clinical and pathologic correlates of virus-induced demyelination are largely immune mediated. Furthermore, several pathologic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the development of myelin damage and neurologic deficits, and each of the proposed mechanisms may play a role in disease progression depending on the genetic constitution of the infected animal. The induction of demyelinating disease by virus may be directly relevant to human MS. Several viruses are known to cause demyelination in humans and viral infection is an epidemiologic factor that is consistently associated with clinical exacerbation of MS. It is suggested that viral infection may be a cause of MS, although no specific virus has been identified as a causative agent.",2004-12-31,"Bieber, A.J.; Rodriguez, M.",Myelin Biology and Disorders,,,True,custom_license

The potential applications of monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization against a variety of veterinary pathogens are passive immunization against Moraxella bovis (pinkeye), Bacteroides nodosus (foot rot), EPEC enterotoxin (enteric colibacillosis), Pasteurella haemolytica (pneumonic pasteurellosis), and Streptococcus equi (strangles). Three main areas of application for monoclonal antibodies against bacterial antigens in veterinary medicine are passive immunization, improved immunodiagnostics, and immunotherapy.

The most general concept to begin with is the most important—the microbiological purity of the starting viral culture. For every virus antigen, there should be a parallel normal antigen to serve as the negative control in the test. Normal antigens are prepared by shaminoculating cell cultures with negative culture material and following these cultures through the entire virus culture and antigen preparation steps in exact parallel fashion. Depending on the test and the day-to-day usage, many antigens are preserved by adding thimerosal to the final product to a final concentration of 1:10,000, or sodium azide to a final concentration of 0.1%. Special preparation of antigens is required for many diagnostic tests, monoclonal or polyclonal antibody production, and many enzyme immunoassays tests. Many viruses and antigens have their own peculiarities based on the specific properties of each virus group.

The chapter also discusses those criteria used by various laboratories for determining the degree of purity achieved in virus preparations. Viruses need to be purified for many studies in which properties or structure of the virus must be distinguished from those of the host cells or culture medium, such as analyses of structure of viral polypeptides and function of membrane glycoproteins. Ultracentrifugation is the usual technique of choice for the purification of particles of defined size from their contaminating materials.

These disruptions are expected to be of a large scale, such as the disaster of September 11, only 5% of the time; more often than not, disruptions are minor and on a much smaller scale. These smaller disruptions may be due to short-term power outages, fires, disk drive failures, or computer viruses. Regardless, the firm must make a plan based on a thorough analysis of all scenarios that may affect its normal working, and create and test contingency and recovery measures for such situations. This chapter discusses the salient parts of a BCP, which constitutes a strategy for recovering from sudden and unexpected disruption of critical business functionalities. Business continuity and disaster recovery became more important after the occurrence of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York, which led to widespread failure in financial systems. Developing a business continuity and disaster recovery plan requires setting aside resources and treating the development of the plan as a project for the firm. Once the analysis has been conducted and strategies have been formulated, the plan must be tested using simulated emergency scenarios. These scenarios are also important when it comes to industry-wide testing, which has become more of a focus recently as firms in financial sectors across the world become more deeply interlinked. While it is crucial for each firm to have its own business continuity plan, it is just as important for the industry as a whole to protect its infrastructure, since systems of each firm are intricately linked together in an STP environment.",2008-12-31,"Khanna, Ayesha",Straight Through Processing for Financial Services,,,False,custom_license

Poxviruses cause several important diseases in domestic and wild mammals and birds. Infection with poxviruses usually results in relatively mild disease involving the skin of the infected animals, however, generalized and often fatal disease may also occur, for example, in myxomatosis in rabbits. Close antigenic relationships exist among many poxviruses derived from different animal species. In spite of close antigenic relationships, the poxviruses of rabbits that produce distinct disease syndromes are discussed as separate entities. Virus of the genus Papillomavirus cause papillomas in various animal species and includes two rabbit viruses, the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus and the rabbit oral papillomavirus. The genus Polyomavirus contains one virus of rabbits, the rabbit kidney vacuolating virus. Papillomatosis of wild cottontail rabbits is characterized by the presence of horny warts, usually on the neck, shoulders, or abdomen. The warts begin as red raised areas at the site of infection, grow to become typical papillomas with rough rounded surfaces, and may later develop into large, keratinized horny growths. The rabbit kidney vacuolating virus was isolated in primary rabbit kidney cell cultures from papillomas of cottontail rabbits collected in Kansas. This virus causes vacuolar cytopathic effects in cell cultures. The virus resembles the cottontail rabbit (Shope) papil lomavirus but is a distinct virus. It does not produce papillomas when inoculated into rabbits and does not immunize rabbits against rabbit papillomavirus.",1994-12-31,"DiGiacomo, Ronald F.; John Maré, C.",The Biology of the Laboratory Rabbit,,,True,custom_license

The anatomy of the rabbit eye reflects its niche as a diurnal herbivore. The rabbit has both photopic and scotopic vision without the benefit of a tapetum. Orbits are laterally situated; the rabbit is one of the few animals in which the orbital axis coincides with the visual axis. The shape of the orbit is circular, compared to the cone shaped human orbit. The orbital walls are of bone, except inferiorly, where the wall is formed partially by the muscles of mastication. The superior orbital wall is formed by the frontal bone. The supraorbital process of the frontal bone contains three supraorbital foramina, which are unique feature of the rabbit orbit; the foramina are incisures formed into apertures by a cartilaginous sheet. The optic foramina share a common canal anteriorly with only a thin boney plate to divide them, which disappears posteriorly to form one canal opening into the cranium as a single foramen. Entropion in young rabbits can occur as a primary or as a secondary condition arising from infection. Viral-induced eyelid proliferations can result from infection by the rabbit myxoma and papilloma viruses. The papilloma virus is a part of the papovaviridae and is a DNA virus transmitted by arthropod vectors. The cottontail rabbit in the mid-western United States is most frequently affected, although domestic rabbits are susceptible.",1994-12-31,"Peiffer, Robert L.; Pohm-Thorsen, Laurie; Corcoran, Kelly",The Biology of the Laboratory Rabbit,,,True,custom_license

The PCR screening procedure for nine common respiratory viruses was performed on lung tissue obtained from both asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients.

When bacteria invade tissues, they almost inevitably cause some damage, and this is also true for fungi and protozoa. Cell and tissue damage are sometimes due to the direct local action of the microorganism and microbial toxins. They either interfere with the transcription, translation, and DNA synthesis or change the permeability of the cell membrane. Some of the indirect damage brought about by these microbes is through inflammation and immune responses. Host cells are destroyed or blood vessels injured as a direct result of the action of microbes or their toxins. Inflammatory materials are liberated from necrotic cells, whatever the cause of the necrosis. Also many bacteria themselves liberate inflammatory products and certain viruses cause living infected cells to release inflammatory mediators. The expression of the immune response necessarily involves a certain amount of inflammation, cell infiltration, lymph node swelling, even tissue destruction. Sometimes they are very severe, leading to serious disease or death, but at other times they play a minimal part in the pathogenesis of disease. Other indirect mechanisms of damage include stress, hemorrhage, placental infection, and tumors.",2001-12-31,"Mims, Cedric A.; Nash, Anthony; Stephen, John",Mims' Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease,,,True,custom_license

Interferons Alpha, Beta, and Omega",10.1016/B978-012498340-3/50026-9,,,els-covid,"Publisher Summary Interferon alpha (IFN-α) is a mixture of closely related proteins, termed “subtypes,” expressed from distinct chromosomal genes. Interferon β (IFN-β) is a single protein species and is molecularly related to IFN-α subtypes, although it is antigenically distinct from them. IFN omega (IFN-ω) is antigenically distinct from IFN-α and IFN-β but is molecularly related to both. The genes of three IFN subtypes are tandemly arranged on the short arm of chromosome 9. They are transiently expressed following induction by various exogenous stimuli, including viruses. They are synthesized from their respective mRNAs for relatively short periods following gene activation and are secreted to act, via specific cell surface receptors, on other cells. IFN-α subtypes are secreted proteins and as such are transcribed from mRNAs as precursor proteins, pre-IFN-α, containing N-terminal signal polypeptides of 23 hydrophobic amino acids (aa) mainly. Pre-IFN-β contains 187 aa, of which 21 comprise the N-terminal signal polypeptide and 166 comprise the mature IFN-β protein. IFN-ω contains 195 aa—the N-terminal 23 comprising the signal sequence and the remaining 172, the mature IFN-ω protein. At the C-terminus, the aa sequence of IFN-ω is six residues longer than that of IFN-α or IFN-β proteins. IFN-α, as a mixture of subtypes, and IFN-ω may be produced together following viral infection of null lymphocytes or monocytes/macrophages. The biological activities of IFNs are mostly dependent upon protein synthesis with selective subsets of proteins mediating individual activities. IFNs can also stimulate indirect antiviral and antitumor mechanisms, depending upon cellular differentiation and the induction of cytotoxic activity.",1998-12-31,"Meager, Anthony",Cytokines,,,True,custom_license

The use of viral components for vaccination has been the subject of experimental clinical trials with adenoviruses and influenza subunit vaccines are in current use. The effect of the production of antibodies against viral components during the course of infection is in vivo complement fixation, demonstrable in practice by the developing anti-complementary activity of serum. Other antibody reactions, which may or may not result in neutralization of infectivity, may play an important role in the production of lesions, especially in certain persistent viral infections. Immune complexes in which viral antigens rather than virions are involved may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of some acute infections, such as hemorrhagic dengue and in the glomerulonephritis found in several chronic viral infections. Indeed, antigenemia and the early formation of immune complexes, rather than viremia as such, may provide the pathogenetic basis for the fever and symptoms that mark the end of the incubation period in many generalized viral infections and the prodromal rash may have a similar explanation.",1975-12-31,"FENNER, FRANK; BLANDEN, R.V.",Viral Immunology and Immunopathology,,,True,custom_license

The chapter also explains that a mixture of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and anti-TMV rabbit serum resulted in aggregation of the virus particles, whereas by contrast, such aggregation did not occur when the virus reacted with a control normal rabbit serum. T. F. Anderson and W. M.

Intestinal immune mechanisms must be studied directly and incorporated into models based on the observations made using intestinal cells and not just systemic cells. Numerous reports in the literature compare and contrast mucosal and systemic responses; however, despite their tissue-specific variations, the different tissues do interact. The procedures used to isolate cells from gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) are traumatic or include enzyme digestion. A technique should be selected that is efficient yet gentle enough to provide viable and functional cells. Moreover, the cells contaminating leukocyte preparations can affect the functional assays. This necessitates that positive controls are put through the procedure or even added to intestinal pieces before isolation. If these cells demonstrate a positive response following this handling, then one is more confident of negative results observed in the isolated intestinal cells.",1987-12-31,"ERNST, P.B.; BIENENSTOCK, J.; DYCK, N.; BEFUS, A.D.; LEE, T.D.G.",Cell Separation,,,True,custom_license

Till date, DNA testing in microbiology has been directed predominantly to the detection of organisms that are difficult to culture in vitro, or for various reasons the growth is unlikely. DNA analysis can be used successfully in infections in which there is a mix of pathogens. Apart from the straightforward diagnostic applications, DNA microbiological testing has been used to detect antimicrobial resistance or toxigenic forms of E. coli. More recently, the availability of DNA technology to quantitate HCV and HIV has been useful in planning and monitoring treatment. The pathogenesis of many infections, particularly viral ones, can also be realized from experimental strategies based on light and electron microscopy, cell culture and immunoassay. The advantages that are provided by DNA techniques include the ability to detect latent (non-replicating) viruses and to localize their genomes to nuclear or cytoplasmic regions within cells. Nucleic acid probe techniques (NAT) can also be manipulated to enable a broad spectrum of serotypes to be detectable. This is particularly valuable in those emerging infections where the underlying serotypes are unknown.",2005-12-31,"Trent, Ronald J",Molecular Medicine,,,True,custom_license

Concerns for the health of laboratory animals have mostly focused on spontaneous infections, although disease in laboratory animals may also be caused by genetic or environmental determinants. The presence of various pathogenic microorganisms may cause changes in the organs, resulting in difficulties in the interpretation of the pathological diagnosis included in the evaluation of many microbiological models. The immune system may be modulated by spontaneous infections in the absence of clinical disease. This effect may be either suppressive or activating or both at the same time, but on different parts of the immune system. Some microorganisms have a specific effect on enzymatic, haematological, and other parameters, which are monitored in the animal during an experiment. Organic function disturbances may change the outcome of the experiment without the knowledge of the scientist. Spontaneous infections in an experimental infection model may also compete with the experimental infection, which in the worst cases may fail. Microorganisms present in the animal may contaminate samples and tissue specimens, such as cells and sera. This may complicate the in vitro maintenance of cell lines, and may interfere with experiments performed on cell cultures or isolated organs. To avoid disease, microbial interference, and zoonoses, laboratory animals are produced according to a three-step principle, which include rederivation, barrier protection, and health monitoring. Rederivation means the production of animals to initiate breeding colonies by either caesarian section or embryo transfer.",1999-12-31,"Hansen, A.K.",Handbook of Animal Models of Infection,,,True,custom_license

The disease, originally termed “atypical pneumonia,” was first recognized in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China, which spread rapidly to 26 countries within 5months and eventually led to 8096 human infection cases and 774 deaths. A previously unrecognized coronavirus, named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was later identified as the causative agent of SARS. Subsequent investigation indicated that the source of the human infections originated most likely from infected wildlife animals traded in the live animal markets, with masked palm civets considered the most prominent and important carrier. Large-scale culling of civets appeared to be effective in preventing further outbreaks in the region. Subsequent epidemiological studies showed that civets are intermediate host of SARS-CoV and bats are the likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and a large number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs). Detailed analysis of the massive SARS-CoV genomic sequence data indicated that SARS-CoV experienced a strong selection pressure during different outbreak phases in humans as well as interspecies transmission from animals to humans. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV plays a key role in virus–host interaction and hence is a key determinant of interspecies transmission. It has been shown that minor changes of amino acid (aa) residues in the S protein could lead to dramatic changes in virus susceptibility in animal and human hosts. This chapter focuses on the genetics and evolution of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs in humans, civets, and bats. The events of SARS outbreaks and the accompanying response activities highlight the importance of modern molecular epidemiology in disease investigation and the urgent need to broaden the screening and investigation of unknown viruses in wildlife animals.",2017-12-31,"Shi, Z.; Wang, L.-F.",Genetics and Evolution of Infectious Diseases,,,True,custom_license

This increased cooperation between worldwide regulators has necessitated proactive deliberate efforts towards convergence/harmonisation of regulation, practices and requirements to eliminate or reduce differences. Cooperation and harmonisation of standards in the pharmaceutical domain are already a reality and have become increasingly important during recent decades, with a high level of commitment to these activities by all stakeholders. The worldwide Drug Regulatory Authorities (DRAs) have been working to end an isolationist attitude that cannot resolve current worldwide issues and challenges caused by an ever increasing globalisation. As a result, many cooperation and harmonisation initiatives have been established at the bilateral, regional and global levels as a response to the changing geo-economic-political situation. The spectrum of collaboration varies from simple informal technical cooperation to full integration of systems and regulations. Indeed, all these initiatives can be very different in scope (some are part of a broader harmonisation initiative), level of harmonisation (depending on the political support/commitment), organisation (well-structured versus simple discussion) or advancement (established process vs. pilot projects), but they all work towards convergence of requirements and/or practices. All these multiple worldwide cooperation and harmonisation programmes have evolved rapidly over the past decades.

This harmonisation seems natural and logical in the current environment of increased globalisation imposed by the current geo-economic-political situation. However, even though this is a reality, it is important to analyse whether or not all stakeholders benefit from this increased cooperation and harmonisation, in order to recommend future actions or potential improvements. Cooperation, convergence and harmonisation is indeed not an end in itself. Elimination of differences, agreement on common standards and the increase of cooperation are needed to protect and promote global public health. It is therefore very important to thoroughly analyse the value and impact of the harmonisation and cooperation process, and to determine whether or not all the efforts made throughout the years have indeed met expectations. After many years of experience, it seems important to have a thorough evaluation to answer several important questions: ▸ What has been the benefit of the multiple harmonisation and cooperation initiatives so far? ▸ Should such processes continue? Are there any other alternatives to resolve current challenges? ▸ Should current initiatives and projects be improved? If so, how and what are the priorities? ▸ Would greater harmonisation and closer cooperation be beneficial? Is it possible? Is it necessary? What are the limits of this process? ▸ What are the important lessons from the past and the on-going harmonisation initiatives that should be considered for planning the next steps? This book section’s goal is to answer these important questions by thoroughly evaluating the added value of cooperation, convergence and harmonisation. This book section also reviews the critical parameters and influencing factors for cooperation, convergence and harmonisation.

However, a variety of factors, including confounding environmental variables, rare genetic variants requiring extremely large cohorts, the temporal dynamics of infections, and ethical limitation on human studies, have made the identification and dissection of variant host genes and pathways difficult within human populations. This difficulty has led to the development of a variety of experimental approaches used to identify host genetic contributions to disease responses. In this chapter, we describe the history of genetic associations within the human population, the development of experimentally tractable systems, and the insights these specific approaches provide. We conclude with a discussion of recent advances that allow for the investigation of the role of complex genetic networks that underlie host responses to infection, with the goal of drawing connections to human infections. In particular, we highlight the need for robust animal models with which to directly control and assess the role of host genetics on viral infection outcomes.",2014-12-31,"Ferris, Martin T.; Heise, Mark T.",Advances in Virus Research,,,True,custom_license

In addition to circumventing preexisting human AdV (HAdV) immunity, nonhuman AdV vectors utilize coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor or other receptors for vector internalization, thereby expanding the range of cell types that can be targeted. Nonhuman AdV vectors also provide excellent platforms for veterinary vaccines.

The roles of CD4+ T cells in MS have been clarified by either “loss-of-function” or “gain-of-function” methods, which have been carried out mainly in autoimmune and viral models of MS: experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection, respectively.

Population bottlenecks are frequent during the life cycle of viruses and can reduce viral populations transiently to very few individuals. Viruses have to confront several types of constraints that can be divided in basal, cell-dependent, and organism-dependent constraints. Viruses overcome them exploiting a number of molecular mechanisms, with an important contribution of population numbers and genome variation. The adaptive potential of viruses is reflected in modifications of cell tropism and host range, escape to components of the host immune response, and capacity to alternate among different host species, among other phenotypic changes. Despite a fitness cost of most mutations required to overcome a selective constraint, viruses can find evolutionary pathways that ensure their survival in equilibrium with their hosts.",2016-12-31,"Domingo, Esteban",Virus as Populations,,,True,custom_license

Viruses evolve at different rates of evolution depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intra-host evolution is generally more rapid that inter-host evolution and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered. The mechanisms by which the error-prone viruses evolve render very unlikely the operation of a molecular clock (constant rate of incorporation of mutations in the evolving genomes). Several computational methods are reviewed that permit the alignment of viral sequences and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among viruses.

It consists of decreasing viral fitness by an excess of mutations that render viral proteins sub-optimal or non-functional. Viral extinction by lethal mutagenesis involves several sequential, overlapping steps that recapitulate the major concepts of intra-population interactions and genetic information stability discussed in preceding chapters.

The virus capsid functions to protect the nucleic acid from the environment, and some viruses surround their capsid with a membrane envelope. Most viruses have icosahedral or helical capsid structure, although a few have complex virion architecture. An icosahedron is a geometric shape with 20 sides, each composed of an equilateral triangle, and icosahedral viruses increase the number of structural units in each face to expand capsid size. The classification of viruses is very useful, and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses is the official body that classifies viruses into order, family, genus, and species taxa.

They use energy generated by the host cell, and they exploit the host's machinery to manufacture viral proteins. Many of the cell's organelles, as well as the plasma membrane, are involved in viral replication processes. The organelles involved in protein synthesis, processing, and transport—namely the ribosome, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex—are utilized in the manufacture of viral proteins, as well, and viruses use ATP generated by the host cell's mitochondria. The plasma membrane, made of a phospholipid bilayer, is the cell's primary zone of contact with the extracellular world. As such, it is the first obstacle that a virus must overcome for entry into a cell. The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology states that DNA is replicated to create more DNA, DNA is transcribed into mRNA, and mRNA is translated by ribosomes to create proteins. All viruses are dependent upon the host's translation machinery, and many viruses will use other portions of the cell's replication and transcription mechanisms. DNA polymerase is the major enzyme involved in DNA replication, while RNA polymerase creates messenger RNA. Host ribosomes translate the messenger RNA into proteins, composed of amino acids. Viruses also have many unique strategies to ensure the translation of their proteins over host proteins.",2016-12-31,"Louten, Jennifer",Essential Human Virology,,,True,custom_license

Inside, it releases and replicates its genome while facilitating the manufacture of its proteins by host ribosomes. How this is carried out depends upon the type of viral nucleic acid.

Localized infections replicate at the initial site of infection, while systemic infections spread to additional areas of the body. Viruses are shed into the environment most often through the same route they entered the body. The stability of virions within the environment is dependent upon virion and environmental factors.

Key questions include the source (an infected human, animal, or insect vector), the transmission mechanism, and how the virus is shed and transmitted. Following transmission, pathogenesis is governed by the initial site of replication, whether the virus disseminates within the host, and its tropism for specific tissues and organs. In turn, these steps are dictated by the structure and replication strategy of the virus. In addition to utilizing selected synthetic biochemical pathways in the host cell, viruses frequently reprogram host cells by inducing intracellular signaling pathways that render the cell more permissive. Host–virus interactions also control whether the infection is acute, chronic, latent, or transforming; how the virus interacts with the immune system; and the consequent pathophysiological response of the host.

Technological and analytical advances can enhance traditional epidemiological methods to study the emergence, epidemiology, and transmission dynamics of viruses and associated diseases. Social media are increasingly used to detect the emergence and geographic spread of viral disease outbreaks. Large-scale population movement can be estimated using satellite imagery and mobile phone use, and fine-scale population movement can be tracked using global positioning system loggers, allowing estimation of transmission pathways and contact patterns at different spatial scales. Advances in genomic sequencing and bioinformatics permit more accurate determination of viral evolution and the construction of transmission networks, also at different spatial and temporal scales. Phylodynamics links evolutionary and epidemiological processes to better understand viral transmission patterns. More complex and realistic mathematical models of virus transmission within human and animal populations, including detailed agent-based models, are increasingly used to predict transmission patterns and the impact of control interventions such as vaccination and quarantine.

It is the responsibility of governments to ensure that safe and sufficient supplies of blood are available and accessible to all patients requiring transfusion. The provision of safe and efficacious blood for transfusion involves a number of processes, including assessment of the suitability of prospective blood donors to donate blood, blood collection, processing, and testing of blood donations, and the issue of blood and its transfusion to the patients. While blood transfusion can be lifesaving, there are associated risks, particularly the transmission of blood-borne infections including human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C viruses. Screening for transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs) to exclude blood donations at risk of transmitting infection from donors to recipients is a critical part of the process of ensuring that transfusion is as safe as possible. Effective screening for evidence of the presence of the most common and dangerous TTIs can reduce the risk of transmission to very low levels. Blood transfusion services should therefore establish efficient systems to ensure that all donated blood is correctly screened for the appropriate TTIs and that only nonreactive blood is issued for transfusion to patients.",2014-12-31,"Dhingra, N.; Kitchen, A.",Reference Module in Biomedical Sciences,,,True,custom_license

CoVs have been isolated from a variety of species, including birds, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. CoV infections can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease, depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection. Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease. The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002–03 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, during replication in an intermediate host (such as the palm civet), evolved to be able to infect humans efficiently. SARS-CoV infected over 8000 people with approximately 10% mortality rate before it was controlled by public health measures of isolation of infected individuals and contacts.

Virological methods are needed to investigate the etiology of acute viral infection or the reactivation of a latent infection, as well as to follow virus load in antiviral treatments. Serological assays are also used for screening of blood products for the risk of certain chronic infections, evaluation of the immune status, and need for prophylactic treatments in connection with organ transplantations. For diagnostic purposes the following approaches can be used: demonstration of presence of infectious virus or its structural components directly from a patient's specimens or investigation of specific antibody response in serum specimens. Amplification techniques, most commonly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is currently the workhorse of nucleic acid testing for the detection and quantitation of virus genomes. Virus isolation is used to demonstrate infectious virus in a patient's specimens, whereas virus antigens are investigated by antigen detection assays. Serological diagnosis is based on either the demonstration of the presence of virus-specific IgM antibodies or a significant increase in the levels and/or avidity of specific IgG antibodies. Immunoassays are the most commonly used serological assays. Point-of-care tests (POC tests), for antigens, antibodies, and also nucleic acids are also becoming more and more common in diagnostic use.

Many of the new, emerging viruses have an RNA genome, and many are zoonoses. The spread of human immunodeficiency virus, causing acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and the use of immunosuppressive drugs following transplant surgery, have increased the numbers of people in the population that are highly susceptible to emerging virus infections.

These ‘enteric’ viruses occur globally and share similar features. Most are RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of mature absorptive epithelial cells lining the villi of the small intestine, leading to inflammation and villus atrophy. Vomiting and diarrhea can result in dehydration and death if untreated. Despite abundant growth in vivo, they initially proved difficult or impossible to grow in vitro. Most are genetically diverse, species specific, highly infectious within species and transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Severe symptoms are most commonly associated with primary infections of young animals, and are followed by short-lived immunity. Reinfections are common throughout life, but are often only mildly symptomatic. Safe and effective vaccines have been developed to prevent severe rotavirus disease in young children.

Viral infection is associated with both direct (invasive disease) and indirect (immune modulation) effects affecting susceptibility to other infections and promoting allograft rejection. The transplantation recipient is susceptible to a broad array of viral pathogens. Some may be transmitted with the allograft as donor-derived infections, while others result from exposure, either soon after the transplant or from more distant exposures when infection is latent and reactivates in the setting of immune suppression. Simultaneous infections with multiple viral or viral and nonviral pathogens are common. The risk for viral infection is a function of the intensity of exposure and virulence of the specific virus, the intensity of immune suppression used to prevent graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease, underlying immune deficits, and factors affecting host susceptibility. Studies of viral latency, reactivation, and of the cellular effects of viral infection will provide clues for future strategies in prevention and treatment of viral infections.

The majority of these illnesses are caused by fecal contamination, resulting in diarrhea. In places where access to medical care is not readily available, diarrhea can lead to death from dehydration; unfortunately, 1.5 million people, many of whom are children, die annually as a result. There are hundreds of pathogens that may be present in fecal material, making it not feasible to analyze water for all of them. Thus, the microbiological quality of water is monitored using indicator organisms, such as coliform bacteria, enterococci, and/or bacteriophages, which are much simpler and less expensive to detect. The use of indicators, while not perfect, has resulted in a decrease in the incidence of waterborne disease.",2019-12-31,"Yates, Marylynn V.",Encyclopedia of Microbiology,,,True,custom_license

Animal models are extremely important in understanding this interface as well as in bridging the gap between basic science discoveries and clinical medicine. The complex nature of pharmacological and toxicological research involving exposure to xenobiotic and therapeutic compounds necessitates the use of animal models to better understand how these compounds interact with multiple organ systems and cell types. As genomics has expanded, we have become increasingly aware of the impact an individual’s genetic makeup influences these responses. Novel methods have emerged that allow for the rapid development of animal models containing mutant alleles, allowing investigators to model these complex genetic interactions in a dramatically shortened timeline. In this chapter, we emphasize the methods and approaches that can be used in gene targeting, screening strategies, and a variety of genetically modified model organisms. The goal is to provide toxicologists an up to date review on the creation of genetically engineered animal models, which can be used to model genetic susceptibility to disease.",2018-12-31,"Veith, A.C.; Chu, C.; Moorthy, B.",Comprehensive Toxicology,,,True,custom_license

Viruses may evolve at high, uneven, and fluctuating rates among genome sites. The accumulated changes, through either mutation or recombination with other species, are first fixed in the genome of successful individuals that give rise to genetic lineages. The relationship between biological lineages related by common descent is called ‘phylogeny’. For inferring phylogeny, the differences between aligned sequences of genomes and proteins are quantified and depicted in the form of a tree, in which contemporary species and their intermediate and common ancestors occupy, respectively, the terminal nodes, internal nodes, and the root. The tree is characterized by a topology, length of branches, shape, and the root position. A complex mathematical apparatus has been developed for phylogeny inference that can evaluate inter-species differences, facilitate tree building and comparison of trees, and assess the fit between data and tree through, typically, computationally intensive calculations. A reconstructed tree is an approximation of the true phylogeny that practically remains unknown. The phylogenetic analysis is used in applied and fundamental virus research, including epidemiology, diagnostics, forensic studies, phylogeography, evolutionary studies, and virus taxonomy.

Along with the typical two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methods, approaches like pharmacophore, structure-based docking studies, and combinations of ligand- and structure-based approaches like comparative residue interaction analysis (CoRIA) and comparative binding energy analysis (COMBINE) have gained a significant popularity in the computational drug design process. A pharmacophore can be developed either in a ligand-based method, by superposing a set of active molecules and extracting common chemical features which are vital for their bioactivity; or in a structure-based manner, by probing probable interaction points between the macromolecular target and ligands. The interaction of protein and ligand molecules with each other is one of the interesting studies in modern molecular biology and molecular recognition. This interaction can well be explained with the conceptof a docking study to show how a molecule can bind to another molecule to exert the bioactivity. Docking and pharmacophore are non-QSAR approaches in in silico drug design that can support the QSAR findings. Approaches like CoRIA and COMBINE can use information generated from the ligand–receptor complexes to extract the critical clue concerning the types of significant interaction at the level of both the receptor and the ligand.

As with many things in life, Internetwork technology has had both positive and negative effects on society, and Asia has been no exception. One of the negative effects has been a surge in Internet crime. According to a report released by the Gartner Consulting Group, in 2013 smart phone sales exceeded regular phone sales for the first time, with 968 million smart phones sold, representing 54% of the global mobile phone total and an increase of 54% from 2012. The popularity and technology of the mobile Internetwork, especially the smart mobile phone web, has changed the Internetwork landscape through the concept of cloud computing. Cloud computing is distributed computing over a network, using a program or application that can run on many connected computers and in different locations around the globe simultaneously at a reduced cost. This distributed cloud computing presents law enforcement authorities with the unique challenge of policing Internet crime. Cloud computing relies on sharing resources to achieve coherence, and in doing so creates economies of scale for converged infrastructures and shared services. Accordingly, one problem facing the authorities is the presence of trans- and multijurisdictional crimes. In this chapter, I explore this topic in the contexts of Hong Kong and Singapore, as both are key players on the international stage, especially in relation to international finance and information technology. In both locations, infrastructure works to maintain global financial center status. The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows.

The family includes viruses with a segmented negative-sense ssRNA genome (families Bunyaviridae and Orthomyxoviridae) and viruses with a positive-sense ssRNA genome (families Togaviridae and Flaviviridae). Among them are viruses associated with sporadic cases or outbreaks of human disease, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (viruses of the genus Hantavirus), Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHFV, Nairovirus), California encephalitis (INKV, TAHV, and KHATV; Orthobunyavirus), sandfly fever (SFCV and SFNV, Phlebovirus), Tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV, Flavivirus), Omsk hemorrhagic fever (OHFV, Flavivirus), West Nile fever (WNV, Flavivirus), Sindbis fever (SINV, Alphavirus) Chikungunya fever (CHIKV, Alphavirus) and others. Other viruses described in the chapter can cause epizootics in wild or domestic animals: Geta virus (GETV, Alphavirus), Influenza A virus (Influenzavirus A), Bhanja virus (BHAV, Phlebovirus) and more.

Methods for creating customized pathogens that can evade an immune system or work around a conventional antibiotic are discussed. In addition, emerging trends in synthetic biology are discussed. Biological warfare and bioterrorism are multifaceted problems requiring multifaceted solutions. Fortunately, the same advances in genomic biotechnologies that can be used to create bioweapons can also be used to set up countermeasures against them. We currently have in place sophisticated and well-developed biosecurity and biodefense programs. These programs are essential to countering the asymmetric warfare threat, but they are costly and perishable. Future directions in biosecurity and biodefense may very well be determined by the “next event.” However, the most likely events are those that naturally and accidentally threaten human and animal health through the emergence of novel pathogens and the reemergence of others in light of new environmental or societal factors.",2016-12-31,"Ryan, Jeffrey R.",Biosecurity and Bioterrorism,,,True,custom_license

The present World Health Organization (WHO) estimate is that nearly 2billion subjects living in the developing world may have zinc deficiency. This is mainly because they subsist on cereal proteins which contain high quantities of organic phosphate compounds, which combine with zinc making it unavailable for absorption. The major adverse clinical effects of zinc deficiency are growth retardation, decreased cell-mediated immunity, impairment of cognitive functions, increased oxidative stress, and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. Our studies have shown that nearly 30% of healthy, well-to-do elderly subjects living in developed countries may also be zinc deficient due to an increased phytate to zinc molar ratio in their diet. Over 300 enzymes and 2000 transcription factors are now known to require zinc for their functions and stability of their structures, and several studies have now shown that zinc may be a molecular signal for neuronal and immune cells. Fourteen ZIP and 10 ZNT zinc transporters are known to maintain intracellular zinc homeostasis. Therapeutic impacts of zinc on human health are also being investigated. Zinc is being used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in infants and children in developing countries globally, and this has resulted in saving millions of lives. Zinc is now an approved drug for the treatment and maintenance therapy of Wilson's disease, a serious fatal genetic disorder. According to a recent Cochrane Review, zinc is the only treatment which is effective in decreasing the incidence of infections and pain crises in patients with sickle cell disease. Zinc acetate lozenges have been shown to decrease the duration of the common cold by 50%, provided the treatment is started within 24h of the onset of symptoms, the solution chemistry of the zinc preparation is proper, and the zinc dosages are adequate. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) accounts for a large proportion of legal blindness in elderly subjects throughout the world. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study Group (AREDS) was supported by National Eye Institute. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has now reported the results of their 10-year zinc supplementation study in patients with AMD. Zinc was effective in decreasing the incidences of blindness and progression of AMD in elderly subjects. Most importantly, zinc-supplemented subjects showed increased longevity and this was due to a decrease in cardiovascular events. No other micronutrient has shown this dramatic effect on decreasing mortality in the elderly. Our placebo-controlled, zinc supplementation trial in the elderly has shown that zinc supplementation decreased the incidence of infections by 66% and improved cell-mediated immunity. Also, we showed that oxidative stress markers and gene expression of inflammatory cytokines were decreased in elderly subjects who received zinc supplementation. These studies suggest that zinc supplementation in the elderly may have a preventive role in atherosclerosis. Plasma zinc is widely used as a biomarker of zinc deficiency in humans. This test is, however, neither specific nor sensitive. Assays of immunological markers such as plasma active thymulin and gene expression of IL-2 in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes are very sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of human zinc deficiency. The assay of zinc in cells such as lymphocytes and granulocytes are better than plasma zinc; however, even these assays are less sensitive than immunological biomarkers.",2017-12-31,"Prasad, Ananda S.","Molecular, Genetic, and Nutritional Aspects of Major and Trace Minerals",,,True,custom_license

Sir William Osler captured the ongoing fear of infectious pathogens when he said, “Humanity has but three great enemies: fever, famine, and war; of these by far the greatest, by far the most terrible, is fever.” Despite the significant impact of antimicrobials and vaccines on public health, there has only been one major human pathogen eradicated—variola virus, the agent of smallpox. In its place have been a series of new and reemerging microbes responsible for isolated infections, regional outbreaks, and global pandemics. Bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens have the capacity to cause widespread epidemics such as the “Black Death” caused by Yersinia pestis in 14th century Europe. However, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are less likely to cause widespread human pandemics at this point in history and are less amenable to vaccine strategies than viral diseases. Focusing on viruses, a catalog of newly discovered human pathogens from the beginning of the 20th century shows a predictable and nearly linear rate of new agents discovered over time. However, of the more than 100 virus families, only 22 have been associated with human infections, a number that seems to have plateaued.

The pathologic hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the presence of focal demyelinated lesions with partial axonal preservation and reactive astrogliosis. Demyelinated plaques are present in the white as well as gray matter, such as the cerebral or cerebellar cortex and brainstem nuclei. Activity of the disease process is reflected by the presence of lesions with ongoing myelin destruction. Axonal and neuronal destruction in the lesions is a major substrate for permanent neurologic deficit in MS patients. The MS pathology is qualitatively similar in different disease stages, such as relapsing remitting MS or secondary or primary progressive MS, but the prevalence of different lesion types differs quantitatively. Acute MS and Balo's type of concentric sclerosis appear to be variants of classic MS. In contrast, neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are inflammatory diseases with primary injury of astrocytes, mediated by aquaporin-4 antibodies. Finally, we discuss the histopathology of other inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated demyelination.

They consist of a nucleic acid genome packaged within a protein shell. Although relatively simple, viruses exhibit significant diversity in terms of size, genome organization, and capsid architecture. All viruses are obligate intracellular parasites as they must obtain energy and building blocks from the cell. They subvert many host cell processes for their own replication, and studying virus replication has provided detailed information about the basic workings of cells. At the cellular level, possible outcomes of infection range from production of virus particles without damage to the cell, to cell death, or occasionally cell transformation. In humans and animals the outcomes of infection range from inapparent (no disease) to considerable disease and death. Some viruses cause acute infections lasting for days or a few weeks while others infect their hosts for a lifetime. Viruses can evolve and rapidly adapt to changing conditions. Some viruses are easily replicated in cultured cells, while others require specific conditions only found in specialized cells within a human or animal. While this text focuses on viruses of humans and other animals, viruses infect organisms of all types, from bacteria to fungi to plants.

It also provides general principles of diagnostic virology. As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses require cell in which to replicate. The cells must express appropriate receptors and other proteins required by the virus. Cultured cells are often used to study basic steps in virus replication. Viruses can be purified away from cellular proteins and organelles using centrifugation techniques. Most viruses cannot be seen using standard light microscopes, but are often imaged using electron microscopy. Methods that combine image collection and computationally demanding image processing can provide incredible details about virus architecture. Another common way to visualize viruses is to use fluorescent tags or dyes. Although these techniques do not show detailed virus structures, they can be used to follow the progress of a virus through a cell and can provide a direct window into protein–protein interactions required for virus replication. A more indirect method to detect viruses is to look for virally induced changes to cell morphology. A variety of basic biochemical techniques are useful for analyzing viral proteins and nucleic acids. As the viral genomes are relatively simple, they can be manipulated/mutated to study the function of virtually any viral protein. Powerful genetic techniques can also be used to generate “designer” cells or organisms. There are a variety of methods for quantitating viruses. Infectivity assays measure the ability of a virus to productively infect a cell. Techniques that identify specific viral proteins or genomes provide ways to rapidly identify viruses. Some of these assays can be used at the bedside, or in the field. Powerful and inexpensive DNA sequencing technologies are being used to identify new viruses, many of which could not be found by other methods.

They are the largest known RNA viruses, with genomes ranging from 25 to 32kb and virions of 118–140nm in diameter. The family is divided into two subfamilies, the Coronavirinae and the Torovirinae. They can be distinguished on the basis of their nucleocapsids as the toroviruses have unique doughnut-shaped nucleocapsids. Virions are roughly spherical and are notable for the large spike (S) glycoprotein that extends from the virus envelope. Current taxonomy places the family in the order Nidovirales. Within the subfamily Coronavirinae are four genera, the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses. All family members share the same unique strategy for mRNA synthesis whereby the polymerase complex jumps or moves from one region of the template to a more distant region.

Much is known about disruption of chromatin-modifying enzymes in malignant disease, but knowledge of irregular epigenetics in immune-driven disorders is just emerging. Epigenetic factors, such as DNA or histone modifications, are indispensable for precise gene expression in diverse immune cell types. Thus a disruption of epigenetic landscapes likely has a large impact on immune homeostasis. Moreover, the low concordance rates for most autoimmune diseases suggest that epigenetics contribute to immune tolerance disturbance. Here we review the important role of epigenetics for initiation, maintenance, tolerance, and training of immune responses. We discuss evolving evidence that DNA/histone modifications and chromatin-modifying enzymes are altered in immune-based diseases. Furthermore, we explore the potential of small molecules targeting epigenetic machinery, some of which are already used in oncology, as a way to reset the immune response in disease.",2016-12-31,"Mehta, S.; Jeffrey, K.L.",Medical Epigenetics,,,True,custom_license

They are able to achieve this by virtue of their ability to multiply very rapidly, coupled with their extraordinary degree of genetic heterogeneity. RNA viruses exist not as single genotypes, but as a swarm of related variants, and this genomic diversity is an essential feature of their biology. RNA viruses have a variety of mechanisms that act in combination to determine their genetic heterogeneity. These include polymerase fidelity, error-mitigation mechanisms, genomic recombination, and different modes of genome replication. RNA viruses can vary in their ability to tolerate mutations, or “genetic robustness,” and several factors contribute to this. Finally, there is evidence that some RNA viruses exist close to a threshold where polymerase error rate has evolved to maximize the possible sequence space available, while avoiding the accumulation of a lethal load of deleterious mutations. We speculate that different viruses have evolved different error rates to complement the different “life-styles” they possess.",2016-12-31,"Barr, J.N.; Fearns, R.",Genome Stability,,,True,custom_license

Good housekeeping and regular inspection of all areas, effective boilouts, and regularly scheduled washups reduce slime development. Conventional slime control methods generally employ combinations of biocides. Alternative control measures use enzymes, biodispersants, bacteriophages, competing organisms, and biological complex formers. Using enzymes for slime control is expected to bring important benefits to the pulp and paper industry. Enzymes represent a clean and sustainable technology: they are nontoxic, readily biodegradable, and are produced using renewable raw materials.

These vaccines have to meet requirements for safety, quality, and efficacy. In addition to antigenic components, various adjuvants may be included in vaccines to evoke an effective immune response. To ensure the safety of new vaccines, preclinical toxicology studies are conducted prior to the initiation of, and concurrently with, clinical studies. There are five different types of preclinical toxicology study in the evaluation of vaccine safety: single and/or repeat dose, reproductive and developmental, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and safety pharmacology. If any adverse effects are observed in the course of these studies, they should be fully evaluated and a final safety decision made accordingly. Successful preclinical toxicology studies depend on multiple factors including using the appropriate study designs, using the right animal model, and evoking an effective immune response. Additional in vivo and in vitro assays that establish the identity, purity, safety, and potency of the vaccine play a significant role in assessing critical characteristics of vaccine safety.",2017-12-31,"Green, M.D.; Al-Humadi, N.H.",A Comprehensive Guide to Toxicology in Nonclinical Drug Development,,,True,custom_license

The causes of building-related illness (BRI) and sick building syndrome (SBS), which appear to be on the increase, are explained and analyzed. The chapter also focuses on the need for a building’s interior air quality, as this is one of the most pivotal factors in maintaining building occupants’ safety, productivity, and well-being. Other important factors that are focused on are ventilation and filtration, including air cleaners and ventilation systems. The leading inorganic indoor contaminants are discussed such as asbestos, radon, and lead, exposure to which can create significant health risks.

Unlike other immunologically active polysaccharides, inulin has no immune activity in its native soluble form, but when crystallized into the stable delta inulin isoform, it acquires potent immune actions. Most notably, delta inulin enhances both humoral and cellular immune responses against vaccine antigens, translating into enhanced protection against a broad range of viral, bacterial, parasitic, and toxin-mediated diseases. Delta inulin is distinct compared with typical vaccine adjuvants as it does not require adsorption to antigen and does not appear to work through induction of inflammatory danger signals. Delta inulin manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (referred to as Advax) has been proved to be safe and effective in human trials of influenza vaccines, hepatitis B vaccines, and insect sting allergy vaccines. Advax thereby represents a novel nonreactogenic immune modulator with potential utility across a broad range of human prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.",2017-12-31,"Petroski, N.",Immunopotentiators in Modern Vaccines,,,True,custom_license

Differences between published subspecies were supported genetically. At a local scale, populations were generally considered panmictic with minor genetic structure. Although cheetahs have persisted despite low genetic variability, important questions arise from these findings: Does the cheetah have the ability to adapt to and evolve with future changes in environmental and infectious pressure? How would cheetahs cope with further loss of genetic diversity?

Reexport trade was the traditional advantage until 1949, when China adopted a closed-door policy. Industrialization since the 1950s has brought growth and expansion, taking advantage of the low cost of labor and the British legal system. However, the situation changed after the early 1980s, partly because of low costs in China pulled investment from Hong Kong, and the post-1997 political uncertainty also resulted in short-term investment behavior. Economic overheating in the mid-1990s led to severe recession after the Asian financial crisis. Economic restructuring has been slow since 1997. Economic narrowness with concentration in real estate development and finance, together with an increase in welfare spending, lowered competitiveness.

The frequent occurrence of cancer in multicellular organisms suggests that neoplasia, similar to pathogens/parasites, may have a significant negative impact on host fitness in the wild. This is supported by the fact that wildlife cancers have recently been shown to result in significantly increased levels of mortality and concomitant reduction in fitness. By thorough searches of the available literature we provide a comprehensive and an updated list of cancer prevalence and etiology in the wild. We were, however, unable to find data on nontransmissible cancer prevalence in invertebrates and consequently this chapter focuses on cancer in wild vertebrates. Although single cases of cancer are frequently encountered in the wildlife, we were only able to retrieve robust data on cancer prevalence for 31 vertebrate species (12 fish, 3 amphibians, 2 reptiles, 2 birds, and 12 mammals). Cancer prevalence among these vertebrates ranged from as low as 0.2% observed in Canada geese (Branta canadensis) to more than 50% recorded in both Santa Catalina Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae) and Cape mountain zebras (Equus zebra zebra). The high prevalence recorded in some vertebrates strongly suggests that cancer in wildlife may indeed carry significant fitness costs. In spite of this, the low number of published comprehensive studies clearly shows that so far cancer in wildlife has received insufficient attention by biologists. We hope that this chapter will act as a catalyst for further studies focusing on the impact of cancer in wild animals.

The outbreak was eventually controlled by quarantine measures but not before it had caused many fatalities. The original zoonotic source of the SARS virus that caused the outbreak is still unknown but is suspected to be bats. Attempts were made to develop a prophylactic vaccine but the SARS epidemic was over before any vaccines could be tested for human efficacy. As will be discussed in this chapter, coronavirus vaccines present many challenges including low and rapidly waning immunity and the fact that coronavirus vaccines, particularly when formulated with Th2-biased alum adjuvants, can exacerbate coronavirus infection-associated eosinophilic lung immunopathology. Fortunately, this problem can be avoided by formulation of coronavirus vaccines with Th1-type adjuvants that enhance T cell IFN-γ responses, such as, delta inulin or TLR agonists. Hence, appropriate adjuvant selection is vitally important for the development of safe and effective coronavirus vaccines.

His work resulted in current vaccines used for the prevention of measles, mumps, hepatitis A and B, chickenpox, meningitis, and pneumonia, which have saved millions of lives across the globe. The need for close cooperation between public and private agencies, including donors, to promote research in vaccinology is reemphasized by recent global health crises such as the Ebola and Zika viruses, as well as the annual influenza virus threats. Eradication of many diseases is feasible, but requires political support for resources, vaccine development and harmonization of vaccination policies, to be achievable.

John Snow conducted pioneering investigations on cholera epidemics in England and particularly in London in 1854 in which he demonstrated that contaminated water was the key source of the epidemics. His thorough investigation of an epidemic in the Soho district of London led to his conclusion that contaminated water from the Broad Street pump was the source of the disease and, consequently, the removal of the handle led to cessation of the epidemic. He further studied cholera in London homes that were receiving water from two water supply systems; one from the sewage contaminated portion of the Thames River and the other that drew its water upstream from an uncontaminated part of the river. Rates of infection among clients of the distribution system drawing contaminated water far exceeded the, rates among those served by the company whose water intake was from above the contaminated section of the river. This demonstration reinforced the goals of the sanitation movement, which developed sewage drainage systems and water purification systems in cities and towns in the following decades, therewith vastly reducing the threats of cholera, typhoid and many other waterborne diseases. Despite progress being made globally, the public health problems of waterborne disease, including cholera, are by no means gone today, even in high-income countries. The tragic introduction of cholera after the earthquake devastation in Haiti in 2010 resulted in many thousands of cases and deaths from cholera indicating the still-present dangers of diseases spread into disaster situations. Cholera and other waterborne diseases remain some of the heaviest burdens of disease and death in low-income countries, especially after natural disasters or warfare as in Yemen in 2017 and are continuing challenges for global health.",2018-12-31,"Tulchinsky, Theodore H.",Case Studies in Public Health,,,True,custom_license

Each of these disciplines works in systems that face ethical dilemmas, making it important that public health workers have motivation to understand and practice within the ethical guidelines of their profession, thus making ethics an important component of training and practice. The dangers of ethical lapses are overwhelmingly apparent in the case of the Eugenics movement of the early 20th century which metamorphosed from forced sterilizations in many liberal democratic countries into mass murder of physically and mentally handicapped children and adults in Nazi Germany. Between 1939 and 1941, 180 thousand psychiatric patients along with an equivalent number of handicapped children and adults were killed in an organized extermination program in Germany by lethal gassing. This method was then applied to the industrialized murder or Holocaust of six million Jews and millions of other “untermenschen” (sub human) in the greatest genocide in human history. Shortly after World War II ended the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals were conducted including medical doctors, and some were executed for crimes against humanity. This was followed by the 1948 United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and by the World Medical Association’s Helsinki Declaration. Both are widely accepted as cornerstone documents—the latter specifically governing ethical standards related to human experimentation—and are revised regularly since being issued in 1964. But genocide has not disappeared, nor has unscrupulous experimentation such as the Tuskegee experiment on black Americans infected with syphilis and left untreated even after the availability of a cure, penicillin. Ethical standards are now required by “Helsinki Committees”—ethical review boards—in most medical facilities worldwide. Ethical frameworks have evolved in part due to bitter experience of ethical failures later recognized and affecting public health standards of practice. Future generations of public health leaders and staff will face many ethical issues such as mandatory immunization of health workers and school children, and assisted death of terminally ill patients.",2018-12-31,"Tulchinsky, Theodore H.",Case Studies in Public Health,,,True,custom_license

Disease-control advanced and new epidemiologic evidence identified risk factors for the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases such as the cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and others. Medical care also improved and became more accessible through health insurance systems both in the private and governmental sector. Health systems became more combined public–private endeavors, with health insurance for medical- and hospital-care taking center stage. Epidemiology blossomed as a science following World War II, producing vital insights and evidence of contributory factors to noncommunicable diseases. In the 1960s the cumulative evidence of smoking as a direct cause of lung cancer and heart disease was identified as a major public health challenge. These relationships became clear and increasingly accepted after the US Surgeon General’s Report in 1964. In 1974, Hon. Marc Lalonde, Canada’s Minister of National Health and Welfare issued the book A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians, which identified genetic, environmental, personal lifestyle, and medical care as equally important issues in personal and population health. New Perspectives led to the “Ottawa Charter” in 1986 which defined health promotion and has become a vital issue in public health. The health promotion movement immediately found a crucial role in smoking reduction and diet change to deal with the pandemics of lung cancer and heart disease. In the 1980s health promotion found itself at the frontline dealing with the HIV pandemic when there were no biomedical means to stem the pandemic of death from AIDS. Public health had to find new and effective instruments for disease control. A renewed emphasis on social inequalities in health in the 21st century exemplified in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) addressed vulnerable populations with linked targets of reducing poverty, promoting education and gender equality, safer environment, and biomedical disease-control measures as global health policy. This more holistic approach to population health has become a leading element in modern public health largely based on the intellectual contribution of Marc Lalonde.",2018-12-31,"Tulchinsky, Theodore H.",Case Studies in Public Health,,,True,custom_license

This includes financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. Universal health coverage (UHC) means inclusion and empowerment for all people to access medical care, including treatment and prevention services. UHC exists in all the industrial nations except the US, which has a mixed public-private system and struggles with closing the gap between the insured and the uninsured population. Middle- and low-income countries face many challenges for UHC achievement, including low levels of funding, lack of personnel, weak health management, and issues of availability of services favoring middle- and upper-class communities. Community health services for preventive and curative health services for needs in populations at risk for poor health in low-income countries must be addressed with proactive health promotion initiatives for the double burden of infectious and noncommunicable diseases. Each nation will develop its own unique approach to national health systems, but there are models used by a number of countries based on principles of national responsibility for health, social solidarity for providing funding, and for effective ways of providing care with comprehensiveness, efficiency, quality, and cost containment. Universal access does not eliminate social inequalities in health by itself, including a wide context of reducing social inequities. Understanding national health systems requires examining representative models of different systems. Health reform is necessarily a continuing process as all countries must adapt to face challenges of cost constraints, inequalities in access to care, aging populations, emergence of new disease conditions and advancing technology including the growing capacity of medicine, public health and health promotion. The growing stress of increasing obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases, requires nations to modify their health care systems.

Although these have diminished the risk of disease transmission, there are additional steps that could be taken to prevent another blood-borne viral epidemic. A new Office of Blood Product Safety (OBPS) might be established within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to communicate information on the safety and availability of blood and blood products to the public and health care professionals. Furthermore, the costs of collection, processing, and distribution of blood for transfusion should be borne by the public, not individual patients. Another recommendation is to establish an Office for the Control of Pharmaceutical Prices (COPP) within the Department of Health and Human Services to set caps on the prices of blood products, essential drugs, and medical devices. If a pharmaceutical required for human health becomes unavailable, then this Office could authorize subsidies for its production.

In addition to those camelids held in captivity, there are domesticated populations of camelids (except vicuña and guanaco) maintained throughout the world. Most are fairly hardy animals, but there are some specific disease concerns. Domesticated llamas and alpacas have become hobby pets and thus management and genetic issues are an increasing source of disease. These include obesity, vitamin and mineral deficiencies and intoxications, metabolic derangements, and congenital malformations (particularly in the young). Domesticated animals are also more prone to degenerative arthropathy and dental disease as they age than wild camelids. Ovarian hydrobursitis is an important source of infertility in dromedaries.

Even in those companies with crisis management teams (CMTs), the members often do not meet to plan or even discuss how the team would function in an actual situation. The most progressive firms offer the team members, fire brigades, and employees an opportunity to preplan (contingency planning) through mock exercises that replicate industrial disasters, explosions, fires, or tornado alerts. The end result is a better-prepared team of employees ready to respond to any contingency. Unfortunately, many firms have not gone this far. Contingency planning may not have been a traditional security process, but in today’s global business environment the security organization is assuming a much greater role and responsibility for its implementation. Even prior to the events of September 11, 2001, many organizations were becoming more conscious of the need to have contingency plans. A complete contingency planning program has three major elements: 1. Emergency Response 2. Crisis Management 3. Business Continuity: Business Recovery and Business Resumption Emergency response activities involve responding to an incident, crisis or disaster and managing that incident at the scene. Should an incident escalate to the crisis or disaster stage, a CMT should take over managing the crisis to its conclusion. If the crisis or disaster does cause damage to a company building, facility or operation, the CMT should hand over to a business continuity team the responsibility of recovery and resumption.

This is true for virtually every aspect of a virus' replication cycle from virus entry to the budding or release of progeny virus particles. In this chapter, we will discuss new information on the impacts of virus-mediated manipulation of Dynein motor complexes and associated machineries and factors. We will highlight how these host cell components impact on pathogenicity and immune responses, as many of the virus-mediated hijacked components also play pivotal roles in immune responses to pathogen insult. There are several comprehensive reviews that define virus–Dynein interactions including the first edition of this book that describes how viruses manipulate the host cell machineries their advantage. An updated table is included to summarize these virus–host interactions. Notably, barriers to intracellular translocation represent major hurdles to viral components during de novo infection and during active replication and the generation of progeny virus particles. Clearly, the subversion of host cell molecular motor protein activities takes advantage of constitutive and regulated membrane trafficking events and will target virus components to intracytoplasmic locales and membrane assembly. Broadening our understanding of the interplay between viruses, Dynein and the cytoskeleton will likely inform on new types of therapies. Continual enhancement of the breadth of new information on how viruses manipulate host cell biology will inevitably aid in the identification of new targets that can be poisoned to block old, new, and emerging viruses alike in their tracks.",2018-12-31,"Milev, Miroslav P.; Yao, Xaojian; Berthoux, Lionel; Mouland, Andrew J.",Dyneins,,,True,custom_license

Airborne transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to humans from the environment, animals, or other humans can result in disease. Inhalation is an important route of exposure as the lung is more susceptible to infection than the gastrointestinal tract. Ingested microorganisms must pass through the acidic environment of the stomach before they can colonize tissue while inhaled microorganisms are deposited directly on the moist surfaces of the respiratory tract. Inhalation of microbial aerosols can elicit adverse human health effects including infection, allergic reaction, inflammation, and respiratory disease. Following inhalation, infectious viruses, bacteria, and fungi can establish in host cells of the respiratory tract. Some are translocated and infect the gastrointestinal tract and other tissues. This article discusses human viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases transmitted via aerosols.

A range of different viruses can cause food poisoning/foodborne infection, and infection can result in a myriad of symptoms, ranging from mild, acute disease to chronic, debilitating disease and even death. Due to the inherent differences between bacteria and viruses, namely the fact that viruses do not replicate in food, while bacteria do, viruses are frequently difficult to detect. This is compounded by the fact that many of the viruses associated with enteric disease do not replicate in cell culture. These factors can lead to a lag between reporting, detection and analysis of foodborne viruses versus bacterial agents.

In contrast, colonization with methicillin-resistant S. aureus is rare (approximately 1%), predominantly transient and associated with prior contact to the health care system. Additionally, in recent years livestock-associated S. aureus clones contributed to colonization in humans, especially in those working in close contact to farm animals. A considerable percentage of colonizing S. aureus isolates is equipped with enterotoxin genes. Humans carrying enterotoxigenic isolates represent a contamination source when handling food, thus generating a continuous risk of S. aureus food intoxication. Molecular characterization of isolates colonizing humans and obtained from food, respectively, enables the tracing of food-related outbreaks back to the source of food intoxication. We will summarize current knowledge about the S. aureus population colonizing humans, including those in close contact to animals and food, respectively. Additionally, we will review data on the molecular characterization of S. aureus isolates related to staphylococcal foodborne disease and the elucidation of staphylococcal foodborne outbreaks. Staphylococcal food poisoning is a common foodborne disease, mediated by the ingestion of enterotoxins produced by enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus. For several outbreaks of foodborne S. aureus disease, colonized personnel could be identified as the source of food contamination. However, because of the widespread occurrence of enterotoxigenic strains as human colonizers and the often transient nature of colonization, the source of contamination cannot always be identified unambiguously. Therefore, compliance with hygiene measures is the most important requirement to prevent food contamination by both human colonization and environmental S. aureus reservoirs.",2018-12-31,"Strommenger, Birgit; Layer, Franziska; Werner, Guido",Staphylococcus aureus,,,True,custom_license

First of all, there is no universally common ancestor of viruses. That is, viruses are polyphyletic and, so far, it has not been possible to construct a tree of viruses or to include them in the tree of life. Yet we classify and study viruses in the realm of biological sciences for a number of reasons. Viruses have exploited the nucleic acid and sequence space to their limits; they have also managed to create strategies of encoding information and expressing it in a unique manner that is foreign to cellular organisms; they vary in shape and form, infect only one host or a myriad of hosts, and some insert themselves into the genome of their host, changing its real-time performance or even its evolutionary history, sometimes benefiting the host or causing its death. In this chapter we briefly review the diversity in virus structure, genome organization, and features of virus replication in cells or organisms they infect; essentially we examine the ways viruses have become conspicuously present in our lives and how we seek to organize and make sense of their diversity.",2018-12-31,"Fermin, Gustavo",Viruses,,,True,custom_license

These entities do not undergo division, but rather generate new particles through the assembly of preformed components. Some viruses go further by modifying cellular metabolism to create a more favorable environment for viral gene expression. In a few instances, these clever strategies also facilitate escape from the host’s defense responses. The process of replication is typically divided into the phases of attachment, entry, uncoating, genome replication and expression, assembly, maturation, and finally, egress or release from the host cell. In this chapter, we address genome replication and expression, including the multiple strategies that serve to control gene expression and ensure preferential propagation of the virus.",2018-12-31,"Rampersad, Sephra; Tennant, Paula",Viruses,,,True,custom_license

It is used by weaker sections of society, such as marginal farmers as insurance against crop failure, for ready cash and to ensure basic economic returns and the empowerment of women and children. However, backyard farming does not appear to be a promising strategy to achieve the poverty reduction until the production level is increased. The major constraint in increasing the production in backyard birds is microbial infection due to lack of biosecurity knowledge among the farmers. The mitigation of the microbial infection depends on the detection of the infection route and its prevention. The source of microbial infection (Salmonella, Escherichia coli) and their dissemination through the eggs in backyard flocks kept in different agroclimatic zones of West Bengal, a major egg producing state in India, was identified. The pattern of virulence gene specially associated with urinary tract infection and antibiotic resistance genes, such as extended spectrum β lactamase (ESBL) genes of the isolates was studied.

Mucosal vaccines are more favored to prevent mucosal infections from the portal of entry. Although mucosal vaccination has many advantages, licensed mucosal vaccines are scarce. The most widely studied mucosal routes are oral and intranasal. Licensed oral and intranasal vaccines are composed mostly of whole cell killed or live attenuated microorganisms serving as both delivery systems and built-in adjuvants. Future mucosal vaccines should be made with more purified antigen components, which will be relatively less immunogenic. To induce robust protective immune responses against well-purified vaccine antigens, an effective mucosal delivery system is an essential requisite. Recent developments in biomaterials and nanotechnology have enabled many innovative mucosal vaccine trials. For oral vaccination, the vaccine delivery system should be able to stably carry antigens and adjuvants and resist harsh physicochemical conditions in the stomach and intestinal tract. Besides many nano/microcarrier tools generated by using natural and chemical materials, the development of oral vaccine delivery systems using food materials should be more robustly researched to expand vaccine coverage of gastrointestinal infections in developing countries. For intranasal vaccination, the vaccine delivery system should survive the very active mucociliary clearance mechanisms and prove safety because of the anatomical location of nasal cavity separated by a thin barrier. Future mucosal vaccine carriers, regardless of administration routes, should have certain common characteristics. They should maintain stability in given environments, be mucoadhesive, and have the ability to target specific tissues and cells.",2020-12-31,"Rhee, Joon Haeng",Mucosal Vaccines,,,True,custom_license

Replication of RVs is restricted in a host species-specific manner, and this barrier is determined predominantly by the host interferon (IFN) signaling and the ability of different RV strains to successfully negate IFN activation and amplification pathways. In addition, viral attachment to the target intestinal epithelial cells also regulates host range restriction. Several studies have focused on the role of the innate immune response in regulating RV replication and pathogenesis. The knowledge accrued from these efforts is likely to result in rational attenuation of RV vaccines to closely match circulating (and host species-matched) virus strains.

Thus the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues represent an important target for vaccination. Indeed, more than 20 years of research have clearly demonstrated the benefits of mucosal vaccination versus systemic vaccination. Such benefits include local induction of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) as well as activation and maturation of mucosal dendritic cells, homing of effector cells to the mucosal surfaces, expression of specific host defense peptides, and other innate effector molecules. In addition, mucosal vaccination offers the opportunity to induce colostral and lactogenic immunity during pregnancy and the possibility of avoiding neutralization of early life vaccines by maternal antibodies, both of which are critical for protecting the most susceptible from infectious diseases. Moreover, mucosal administration offers the advantage of inducing both effective systemic immunity and mucosal immunity, enhancing vaccine efficacy and providing improved protection. A number of animal vaccines are already administered via the mucosal surfaces, with many more to come over the next few years. It is gratifying to see that veterinary vaccine development has yet again taken a leadership role in exploring innovative approaches and technologies to mucosal vaccination. For the veterinary field, considerations for mucosal vaccine development and use necessarily include costs (often pennies per dose), mass delivery that preferably avoids animal restraint, and economic and trade considerations. In this chapter, we provide an overview of some of the existing vaccine technologies and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.",2020-12-31,"Wilson, Heather L.; Gerdts, Volker; Babiuk, Lorne A.",Mucosal Vaccines,,,True,custom_license

The vast importance of the Tree of Life falls into several general categories. First, the immense overall importance of biodiversity not only involves providing food, medicines, and ecosystem services such as clean air and water, but also a second major theme of this chapter is the importance to human well-being of knowledge of how species are related. Knowledge of how organisms are related has predictive value. We all know from our own family trees that relationships matter. For example, if a close relative has a disease or cancer that is genetically inherited, we realize that there is a chance we may have inherited that trait. Similarly, broad knowledge of relationships is fundamental, providing crucial new information regarding the discovery of medicines, combatting disease, crop improvement, while also providing insight into the study of ecosystem function and services (clean air and water). Knowledge of species relationships and the Tree of Life can help in the discovery of new medicines—closely related organisms produce similar chemicals; similarly, that knowledge of relationships is essential to improve crops by identifying close wild relatives that may have important traits (disease resistance, drought tolerance). Knowledge of the Tree of Life can also aid in the study of ecology and conservation efforts. As closely related species will often respond in similar ways to environmental factors such as temperature and moisture availability, the Tree of Life can also provide critical information in predicting how species may respond to climate change.",2019-12-31,"Soltis, Douglas E.; Soltis, Pamela S.",The Great Tree of Life,,,True,custom_license

From the ages of 10–25, adolescents and the role that their pets play in each other’s lives change dramatically. Here, we present three adolescent stages and the value of relationships adolescents have with their pets during these distinct stages. How studies have looked at ways pets influence or impact an adolescent’s life will be explored. The chapter also looks more specifically at a pet’s impact on physical health, social-emotional development, and socialization during the adolescence. We examine specific populations of adolescents, such as college students, rural adolescents, homeless adolescents, at-risk adolescents including adolescents who are suicidal, adolescents participating in canine-assisted therapy, and how their pet’s aide the adolescent. Lastly, experiences from several adolescents are provided.",2019-12-31,"Piper, Lynn J.; Uttley, Clarissa M.",Clinician's Guide to Treating Companion Animal Issues,,,True,custom_license

Maintenance resource management (MRM) or maintenance human factors (MHF) programs started with a unique, three-party research program. The aviation industry (airlines and repair stations), federal agencies (the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)), and the academic community came together to study specific safety issues in the technical operations environment (line and base maintenance facilities, maintenance, repair, and overhaul-MRO-facilities, as well as ramp operations). The FAA and NASA funded this research, university faculty members and students conducted the research activities, and the industry partners provided access to facilities and personnel. At an international level, the FAA and NASA, Transport Canada, and United Kingdom. Civil Aviation Authority participated in another three-way partnership that enabled information sharing among the researchers, regulators, and practitioners. This chapter also reviews some of the most commonly used incident review tools and the associated taxonomies. With the increased use of structured approach to incident investigation, the use of MRM programs moved from simple awareness programs to reactive error-correction programs, and subsequently matured to proactive, error-avoidance programs, paving the way for predictive trend analysis programs. Finally, this chapter reviews the influence of MRM programs on the safety culture in technical operations and identifies some emerging opportunities for continued research and development.",2019-12-31,"Patankar, Manoj S.",Crew Resource Management,,,True,custom_license

Only about 30% of the fresh water total is available on earth, in groundwater and surface water, for drinking and other daily human activities as well as industrial and agricultural activities. Further, 20% of the available fresh water is not available to humans living in remote areas, 60% of fresh water cannot be captured, as it comes at inconvenient times and places (e.g., monsoons and floods), and 18% of fresh water is contaminated by human activities. Only about 2% of fresh water is available for usage. Developed countries have advanced technology for water treatment and are thus able to manage the problem of water scarcity to a large extent, but advanced technology is largely unprocurable in developing and undeveloped countries due to cost. Based on the current population growth rate, it has been estimated that over 3.5 billion people will be in a water scarcity condition by 2025. The problem has become exacerbated due to the introduction of various recalcitrant, nondegradable compounds by agricultural and industrial activities. These compounds cannot be removed completely by any current available technologies.

Steviol glucosides include rubusoside (Ru), stevioside (Ste), and rebaudioside (Reb), which have immunomodulatory capability and protective effects against hyperglycemia, hypertension, inflammation, tumors, and diarrhea. In addition, they can enhance the solubility of epotoside, liquiritin, paclitaxel, curcuminoids, quercetin, and wheat bran flavonoids, thus increasing their permeability. The hydrolysis of three glucosyl groups at positions C13 and C19 of Ste will produce steviolbioside, steviol, isosteviol, steviol mono-glucoside, or Ru. S. rebaudiana contains these hydrolyzed products in trace amounts. This chapter describes recent advances in the preparation of various steviol glycosides from Ste by using different β-glycosidases, with particular focus on their potential industrial applications as natural solubilizers of insoluble compounds.

The antibody is unique to humans, apes, and Old World monkeys, and it binds specifically to a mammalian carbohydrate antigen called the α-gal epitope that is synthesized in nonprimate mammals, lemurs (prosimians) and New World monkeys by the glycosylation enzyme α1,3GT. The α1,3GT gene (GGTA1) appeared in mammals >100 million years ago, prior to the split between marsupial and placental mammals. This gene has been conserved in its active form, in all mammals, except for Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. Inactivation of the α1,3GT gene in ancestral Old World primates occurred 20–30 million years ago and could have been associated with epidemics of enveloped viruses in the Eurasia-Africa continent. It is suggested that prior to such epidemics, few ancestral Old World primates acquired deletion point mutations that inactivated the α1,3GT gene and eliminated α-gal epitopes. This resulted in loss of immune tolerance to the α-gal epitope and thus, in production of the anti-Gal antibody against antigens on bacteria colonizing the GI tract. This accidental inactivation of the α1,3GT gene in very small populations is analogous to the highly rare blood type “Bombay” individuals who do not synthesize blood group H (O antigen) because of inactivation of the α1,2-fucosyltransferase gene. The loss of immune tolerance to blood group H antigen has resulted in production of natural anti-blood group H antibodies in the blood group Bombay individuals. It is suggested that anti-Gal protected against infections by enveloped viruses presenting α-gal epitopes, which were lethal to the parental primate populations that conserved active α1,3GT and thus, synthesized α-gal epitopes. Alternative causes for the elimination of Old World primates synthesizing α-gal epitopes could be bacteria or protozoa parasites presenting α-gal or α-gal-like epitopes, and bacterial toxins, or detrimental viruses that used α-gal epitopes in these primates as “docking receptors.” Ultimately, any of these proposed selective processes could result in extinction of Old World primates synthesizing α-gal epitopes on their cells. These ancestral primates were replaced by offspring populations lacking α-gal epitopes and producing the anti-Gal antibody, which continues to be produced by Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. New World monkeys and lemurs were protected from pathogens of the Old World by oceanic barriers, thus they continue to synthesize α-gal epitopes and lack the ability to produce the anti-Gal antibody. This scenario of few individuals in a large population having a mutation(s) that inactivates a glycosyltransferase gene thus, resulting in production of evolutionary advantageous natural antibodies against the eliminated carbohydrate antigen, may reflect one of the mechanisms inducing changes in the carbohydrate profile of various mammalian populations.",2018-12-31,"Galili, Uri",The Natural Anti-Gal Antibody As Foe Turned Friend In Medicine,,,True,custom_license

This is likely related to regular acute (and possibly chronic) periods of exercise-induced changes in immune function. URT infections can compromise performance directly if suffered shortly before or during competition or indirectly if suffered at other times via effects on training and/or physiological adaptations.

These enzymes are essential in RNA metabolism, where they are involved in a number of processes that require manipulation of RNA structure. Recent studies have found that some DEAD/DEAH-box helicases play important roles in innate immunity, where they act as sensors of cytosolic DNA/RNA, as adaptor proteins, or as regulators of signaling and gene expression. In spite of their function in immunity, DEAD/DEAH-box helicases can also be hijacked and exploited by viruses to circumvent detection and aid in viral replication. These findings not only imply that DEAD/DEAH-box helicases have a broader function than previously thought, but also give us a much better understanding of immune mechanisms and diseases that arise due to the dysregulation or evasion thereof. In this chapter, we demonstrate the known scope of activities of human DEAD/DEAH-box helicases in innate immunity and interaction with viruses or other pathogens.

In response to variations in the extracellular environment, the collective behavior of cell populations can be coordinated by regulating community-level gene expression. This mechanism is strongly conserved during evolution, being shared both by bacterial communities and central nervous system cells. Notably, cyclic dipeptides (CDPs) are molecules that are implicated in these quorum sensing behaviors in both settings. Bacteria coordinate their collective behavior by producing CDPs (quorum sensing inducers) that enhance the capacity of individual members of the community to detect these signals and thus amplify the community-level response.

The virus can cause substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. It can affect the upper respiratory tract and the reproductive tract, and some strains can cause nephritis. The causative agent IBV is an RNA virus with great ability for mutation and recombination, thus capable of generating new virus strains that are difficult to control. There are many IBV strains found worldwide, including the Massachusetts, 4/91, D274, and QX-like strains that can be grouped under the classic or variant serotypes. In addition, new types of the virus continue to arise due to mutations and recombination events in the viral genome and even more factors, making this virus difficult to identify and extremely difficult to control. Surveillance and identification of IBV types are extremely important for control of the disease and the advancement of molecular methods has aided in this pursuit. Genetic typing of IBV, which involves reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene, has revolutionized diagnosis and identification of this virus by making it possible to type and compare the relatedness of a large number of virus isolates in a short period of time. Several conventional and molecular diagnostic methods have been described for the diagnosis of IB in chickens. “All-in/all-out” operations of rearing along with good biosafety measures form the basis of prevention, whereas vaccination forms the backbone of IB control program. Both live and inactivated (oil emulsified) conventional vaccines are available. The new generation vaccines (recombinant and vector-based) developed against locally prevailing IBV strains may be more helpful and avoid the reversion of virulence in live vaccine viruses.",2020-12-31,"Ennaji, Youssef; Khataby, Khadija; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens,,,True,custom_license

The IBV strains circulating in poultry farms are serotypes/genotypes Italy02 and Massachusetts (Mass) identified during 2010–14. The appearance of these variants hinders the prophylactic strategy carried out by the breeders of the Moroccan poultry farm. To solve this problem, we have opted for the rational design of candidate vaccines in order to study the structure of the three-dimensional (3D) S1 spicule protein of serotype Italy02 and Mass H120, through molecular modeling, using the I-TASSER server, then the COACH, and another Meta server to determine and predict the common immunogenic active sites between these two IBV strains circulating in Morocco. The obtained results showed that the two strains studied had identical spatial conformation of the S1 protein structure with a similarity percentage of 81% and an average stability of the modeled sequences. Thus both serotypes share active antigenic sites common in the hypervariable region, located at residues 229, 230, 232, 233, and 235, with a magnesium molecule association around the Alanine 280 region responsible for stimulating immunogenicity. The quality of the 3D conformation, the stability, and the percentage make it possible to have accessibility to the common predicted neutralizing epitopes. Based on these data, we can conclude that it is highly probable that the H120 vaccine strain confers cross-protection against a challenge with new strains Italy02 circulating in Morocco.",2020-12-31,"Khataby, Khadija; Kasmi, Yassine; Souiri, Amal; Loutfi, Chafiqa; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens,,,True,custom_license

Although it is essential to consider the nonprotein-coding part that represents approximately 80% of the human genome. Thus advances in sequencing techniques have led to the discovery of thousands of RNAs with low or no capacity to encode proteins but are exhibiting crucial biological functions. Long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) (lncRNAs) are a heterogeneous class of these ncRNAs that are longer than 200nt. Accumulating evidences have demonstrated the involvement of these molecules in development and physiological processes, especially through their regulation of gene expression. LncRNAs are encoded in mammalian cells as well as in microorganisms and viruses. Several studies have found differential expressions of lncRNAs in response to viral infection of emerging viruses, which suggest important roles. In fact, they are involved in promoting viral replication, evading host immunity and regulating the host response to the infection. In addition, lncRNAs do not induce immune response compared to viral proteins; thus viruses might employ them as an effective strategy to invade their hosts. In this chapter, we discuss particularly the emerging virus–host interaction associated lncRNAs through addressing their involvement in the mechanisms underlying emerging viral infections as well as in the pathways of immune system in response to these infections. We also discuss the promising role of these noncoding transcripts as biomarkers for diagnosing viral pathologies.",2020-12-31,"Lamsisi, Maryame; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens,,,True,custom_license

Emerging and reemerging pathologies are still considered to be dangerous to humanity because of the unique nature of these diseases: it is the encounter between two living organisms that have coexisted for millions of years within the people on the same planet without being previously recognized. These infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites, pose no threat to humans. In fact, only a few hundred are able to inflict damage to the human host. In addition, the spectrum of human disease caused by a particular pathogen varies considerably depending on the factors related to the ecological agent, the host, and the infectious agents. Several emerging or reemerging infectious agents are organisms that could be used in biological control. The differentiation of a natural epidemic from a bioterrorian event is based on several epidemiological indices as well as on the molecular characterization of the pathogen(s) involved. The role of pathologists is indeed very important. It is in this context that this chapter aims to discuss the various scientific advances, particularly molecular, in terms of diagnosis of these diseases; the new discoveries in the role of nanotechnologies and nanobiosensors; and also the implication of biomarkers, especially microRNAs (miRNAs), since it was reported that a single miRNA has the ultimate capacity to target multiple genes simultaneously. In a viral infection context, miRNAs have been connected with the interplay between host and pathogen and occupy a major role in the host–parasite interaction and pathogenesis. It is in this context that various molecular and nanomethods for the detection of emerging viruses and experimental validation of miRNAs during quelling viruses target transcripts will be discussed in this chapter.",2020-12-31,"Hammou, Rahma Ait; Benhassou, Mustapha; Bessi, Hlima; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens,,,True,custom_license

While many viruses are studied to seek solutions for their adverse impact on human, veterinary, and plant health, the study of baculoviruses was stimulated initially by their potential utility to control insect pests. Later, the utility of baculovirus as gene expression vectors was evidenced leading to numerous applications. Several strategies are employed to obtain recombinant viruses that express large quantities of heterologous proteins. A major step forward was the development of bacmid technology (the construction of bacterial artificial chromosomes containing the genome of the baculovirus) which allows the manipulation of the baculovirus genome in bacteria. With this technology, foreign genes can be introduced into the bacmid by homologous and site-directed recombination or by transposition. Baculoviruses have been used to explore fundamental questions in molecular biology such as the nature of programmed cell-death. Moreover, the ability of baculoviruses to transduce mammalian cells led to the consideration of their use as gene-therapy and vaccine vectors. Strategies for genetic engineering of baculoviruses have been developed to meet the requirements of new application areas. Display of foreign proteins on the surface of virions or in nucleocapsid structures, the assembly of expressed proteins to form virus-like particles or protein complexes have been explored and validated as vaccines. The aim of this chapter is to update the areas of application of the baculoviruses in protein expression, alternative vaccine designs and gene therapy of infectious diseases and genetic disorders.

Novel pathogens and transmission methods can easily be exploited to cause disease outbreaks. Advancements in molecular biology that make it possible to genetically modify, edit, or disrupt the genome of pathogens increase the disease risk of an accidental or intentional release of pathogens with pandemic potential. The occurrence of a disease at more than an endemic level may stimulate an investigation to determine the source of the disease, who has the disease, when it occurred, and how it spreads. When intentional release of pathogens is suspected, investigators have the additional task of attributing the outbreak not only to a pathogen but also to a human source. The deliberate nature of such dissemination may be obvious. However, some forms of bioterrorism may be more covert, requiring molecular methods to uncover. The field of microbial forensics emerged following the anthrax attack in the United States in 2001 to extend epidemiologic principles to aid in the investigation of bioterrorism incidents. Microbial forensics combines epidemiology with genomic and microbiologic methods, to identify, characterize, and ascribe the cause of an incident resulting from the intentional or unintentional release of a harmful pathogen. Unlike routine epidemiologic investigations, microbial forensic investigations are undertaken when there is a potential crime due to the release of a pathogen with disease-causing potential. The investigation is conducted to attribute cause to a source based on indisputable evidence and is used to support criminal charges against the perpetrator(s). However, because bioterrorism may be unannounced, the initial investigation will start the same as to any public health incident of concern.

Principal methods that are sufficiently developed are characterization of the humoral immune response to microbial antigens including vaccine-induced immunity and detection of antibiotics that may be present in a possible perpetrator. This chapter presents central elements of the host response in a simplified fashion and describes a representative example, which, in the appropriate context, has a high potential of providing evidence that may aid an investigation to distinguish a perpetrator from a victim.

Our results indicated that the percentage of completed research on the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram show that 50% of the studies were done on Twitter, 27% on Facebook, and 23% on Instagram. Twitter seems to be more popular and recent than the other two spheres as there are more studies on it. Further, we extracted the studies based on the year and graphs in 2015 which indicated that more research has been done on Facebook to analyze the behavior of users and the trends are decreasing in the following year. However, more studies have been done on Twitter in 2016 than any other social media. The results also show the classifications based on different methods to analyze individual behavior. However, most of the studies have been done on Twitter, as it is more popular and newer than Facebook and Instagram particularly from 2015 to 2017, and more research needs to be done on other social media spheres in order to analyze the trending behaviors of users. This study should be useful to obtain knowledge about the methods used to analyze user behavior with description, limitations, and results. Although some researchers collect demographic information on users’ gender on Facebook, others on Twitter do not. This lack of demographic data, which is typically available in more traditional sources such as surveys, has created a new focus on developing methods to work out these traits as a means of expanding Big Data research.",2019-12-31,"Singh, Amandeep; Halgamuge, Malka N.; Moses, Beulah",Social Network Analytics,,,True,custom_license

The microbes are nonpathogenic and are safe to handle and dispose. The process is environmentally-friendly and is less expensive than solvent cleaning, but it is not applicable to high precision cleaning applications.

These plants act as protein factories that can synthesize a variety of proteins free from pathogens such as plasma proteins, growth factors, and vaccines. This method provides a novel, tempting, inexpensive, easy, and safe alternative to other techniques of protein or antigen production. With the advent of transgenic plants, it is possible to produce unlimited amounts of subunit vaccines (for oral use/edible and of parenteral use), protein used for pharmaceutical/medicinal purpose, recombinant proteins, antibodies, and industrial enzymes. Plants have numerous advantages over the production systems on account of scalability, safety, and are economic; for example, less cost of production is involved for Hepatitis B nucleocapsid antigen using transgenic tobacco. Biopharming or molecular farming provides an important resource for cheaper drug production used in the treatment of cancer, heart diseases, and infectious diseases. The pharmaceutical products are manufactured by genetically engineered plants that are extracted and purified, also known as pharmaceuticals produced by plants. Edible vaccines are cheaper in cost, easy to administer mostly by oral route, fail-safe, and are acceptable by society especially in developing countries. These vaccines are targeted to provide systemic as well as mucosal types of immunity. It has been predicted that in future children may get their immunization by munching on foods instead of getting enduring shots. The production of edible vaccines consists of the process of introducing the selected genes of desired quality into plant to induce these altered or transgenic plants to produce the encoded proteins in a natural way. These vaccines provide safer alternatives and help in reduction of cost of production and shipping and also decrease the potential hazards associated with conventional vaccines. However, becoming a reality and readily availability of edible vaccine is challenged by many problems of technical, regulatory, and nonscientific issues, which should be ruled out and rectified.

New effective solutions for the treatment of wastewater led to an improvement of the quality of the final effluent but considerably increased the volume of produced sewage sludge, which increases each year. Two points of view conflict regarding the recycling of those “wastes.” Primarily, dehydrated sewage sludge is considered a reservoir of nutrients and organic matter that can be used as a fertilizer in agriculture or as an organic amendment in the remediation of contaminated sites or to build “anthroposoils.” On the other hand, recycled sewage sludge is seen as a potential source of soil contamination by organic and inorganic pollutants and pathogens; potentially toxic elements (such as zinc, copper, cadmium, lead, silver, etc.); polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH); polychlorobiphenyls (PCB); biocides and phytopharmaceuticals; pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCP), and residuals; synthetic hormones; microplastics; nanotechnology life cycle end products; and microorganisms such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 or Salmonella typhimurium.

They have been shown to be produced and released by many different types of healthy and diseased cells. Exosomes are secreted by all types of cells in culture, and are also found in various body fluids including blood, saliva, urine, and breast milk. Exosomes are essential for healthy physiological as well as pathological processes. In addition to their normal function, exosomes are involved in the development and progression of various diseases, potentiating cellular stress and damage. Pathogens take advantage of exosome release from infected host cells by manipulating host-derived exosomes to evade the immune system responses. Exosomes are involved in other pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, liver diseases, heart failure, cancer, diabetes, kidney diseases, osteoporosis and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Hence, we can exploit exosomes as biomarkers and vaccines and modify them rationally for therapeutic interventions including tissue engineering. Further studies on exosomes will explore their potential and provide new methodology for effective clinical diagnostics and therapeutic strategies: such uses can be called exosome theragnostics.

They are known to occur in higher animals such as Echinoderms, Hemichordata, Cephalochorda, and Vertebrata and also in other animals such as Platyhelminthes, Cephalopoda, and Crustaceae. Plants are known to lack sialic acid. But they are reported to occur in viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. Deaminated neuraminic acid although occurs in vertebrates and bacteria, is reported to occur in abundance in the lower vertebrates. Sialic acids are mostly located in terminal ends of glycoproteins and glycolipids, capsular and tissue polysialic acids, bacterial lipooligosaccharides/polysaccharides, and in different forms that dictate their role in biology. Sialic acid play important roles in human physiology of cell-cell interaction, communication, cell-cell signaling, carbohydrate-protein interactions, cellular aggregation, development processes, immune reactions, reproduction, and in neurobiology and human diseases in enabling the infection process by bacteria and virus, tumor growth and metastasis, microbiome biology, and pathology. It enables molecular mimicry in pathogens that allows them to escape host immune responses. Recently sialic acid has found role in therapeutics.

Most of the infectious diseases are caused by drug-resistant microbes; this may lead to a delay in the administration of microbiologically effective therapy (Chen et al., 2017; Del Chierico et al., 2014). Therefore, exhaustive understanding of microbial physiologies, infection and defense systems, and survival strategies is of great interest in order to actively defeat microbial infection. Microbial proteomics provides complete information of microbial physiology and expression and function of the proteins that are involved in infection and also gives a clue in clinical diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy (Pérez-Llarena and Bou, 2016; Vranakis et al., 2014). Microbial proteomics helps to identify the proteins associated with microbial activity, microbial host-pathogen interactions, and antimicrobial resistant mechanism. Microbial activity of pathogens can be confirmed by using the 2-D gel-based and gel-free method with the combination of MALDI-TOF-LC-MS/MS. Proteomic analysis of microbial host-pathogen interaction reveals valuable information about the virulence of the pathogen and its resistance; it helps in better understanding of the infection and for developing strategies against microbial infections (Cheng et al., 2016).

Viruses use all known mechanisms of variation; mutation, several forms of recombination, and segment reassortment in the case of viruses with a segmented genome. These processes are intimately connected with the replicative machineries of viruses, as well as with fundamental physical-chemical properties of nucleotides when acting as template or substrate residues. Recombination has been viewed as a means to rescue viable genomes from unfit parents or to produce large modifications for the exploration of phenotypic novelty.

Population bottlenecks are frequent during the life cycle of viruses and can reduce viral populations transiently to very few individuals. Viruses have to confront several types of constraints that can be divided into basal, cell-dependent, and organism-dependent constraints. Viruses overcome them exploiting a number of molecular mechanisms, with an important contribution of population numbers and genome variation. The adaptive potential of viruses is reflected in modifications of cell tropism and host range, escape to components of the host immune response, and capacity to alternate among different host species, among other phenotypic changes.

Viruses evolve at different rates depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication and a number of environmental influences. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intrahost evolution is generally more rapid that interhost evolution, and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered. The mechanisms by which the error-prone viruses evolve are very unlikely to render the operation of a molecular clock (constant rate of incorporation of mutations in the evolving genomes), although a clock is assumed in many calculations. Several computational tools permit the alignment of viral sequences and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among viruses.

Given the adaptive potential of viruses in general and the RNA viruses in particular, the selection of viral mutants that display some degree of resistance to inhibitors or vaccines is a tangible challenge. Mutant selection may jeopardize control of the viral disease. Strategies intended to minimize vaccination and treatment failures are proposed and justified based on fundamental features of viral dynamics explained in the preceding chapters. The recommended use of complex, multiepitopic vaccines, and combination therapies as early as possible after initiation of infection falls under the general concept that complexity cannot be combated with simplicity.

It consists of decreasing viral fitness by an excess of mutations that render viral proteins suboptimal or nonfunctional. Viral extinction by lethal mutagenesis involves several sequential, overlapping steps that recapitulate the major concepts of intrapopulation interactions and genetic information stability discussed in preceding chapters.

It is a critical resource for the food industry with wide uses. In most of the food preparation and processing operations, water is often taken for granted. Water is very commonly used in food production at various levels, apart from being used as an ingredient. Water quality and its impact on food products and various operations in food industries are often underestimated. Such underestimation often leads to mismanagement of water, equipment operation and maintenance issues, loss of revenue, food safety, and product quality. This chapter deals with several aspects of water as applicable to the food production. Agriculture is the largest consumer of water, requiring over 100 times more than that used for personal needs. The concept of water footprint is used to discern the importance of relative value in terms of water. The water footprint of any animal product is larger than the water footprint of a wisely chosen crop product with equivalent nutritional value. The production of meat requires between 6 and 20 times more water than for cereals and vegetables or fruits. Water is indispensible in cleaning and sanitization in food production, which is an integral part in processing operations in food production. In food storage and preservation, water plays a key role. The water activity of food helps a great deal in deciding shelf-life and food safety. The quality of water is the fundamental consideration in any food production process. The quality depends on the source of water and the actual application in food production. The pollution of water occurs at any stage in various ways. Physical, chemical, or biological agents cause significant health hazards in safe production of food. Contamination of water by several pathological microorganisms creates major challenges in food safety and threats to human and animal health. The majority of diseases which are transmitted through contaminated fresh water, are caused by pathogenic microorganisms. Whenever water is used as an ingredient in food product, it must be free from undesirable taste, odor, color, and impurities, including pathogenic organisms that could jeopardize consumers’ health and gravely affect product quality. The quality of water must adhere to the safe drinking water standard. Various techniques and methods of water treatments should be used to purify water as per the guidelines of government authorities to improve food safety. Soil has multiple roles in deciding water quality. Good quality soil has better ability to remove all types of contaminants of water, whereas deteriorated soil becomes a source of heavy metals, organic chemicals, and soil pathogens in water contamination. Use of genetically modified food is gaining much publicity recently. Even though a controversial topic, great care must be taken when genetically modified food is used. It is mandatory that one should review the basic principles of food safety before consuming any food.",2019-12-31,"Bhagwat, Vinod R.",Food Safety and Human Health,,,True,custom_license

The desirable characteristics of such diagnostic methods are easy to use, cost-effective, highly sensitive, and specific, coupled with the high-throughput detection capabilities. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are still the most common assays used for the detection of animal pathogens across the globe. However, utilizing the principles of ELISA and PCR, several serological and molecular technologies have been developed to achieve higher sensitivity, rapid, and point-of-care (POC) detection such as lateral flow assays, biosensors, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification, and molecular platforms for field-level detection of animal pathogens. Furthermore, animal disease diagnostics need to be updated regularly to capture new, emerging and divergent infectious pathogens, and biotechnological innovations are helpful in fulfilling the rising demand for such diagnostics for the welfare of the society.

On the other hand, chronic diseases will dominate because they occur due to the relevant gene's maladjustment to the modern living environment. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the incompatibilities between the genes and the living environments and, more importantly, to the impact of changes in the living environment. However, specific chronic disease is not caused by a specific environmental factor but occurs when the systems of the human body are affected by exposure to specific environmental factors and work beyond their normal ranges. Therefore, the concept of treating a patient with a chronic disease by simply eliminating the cause of the disease has some fundamental limitations.

In addition, about 82 million metric tons of eggs were produced. One of the bases for this production is the reproductive efficiency of today's poultry. This, in turn, is due to their inherent reproductive physiology, intensive genetic selection and advances in husbandry/management. The system of reproduction in males in largely similar to that in mammals except that there is no descent of testes. In females, there are marked differences with there being a single ovary and oviduct; the latter being the name of the differentiated entire Müllerian duct. Moreover, females produce eggs with a yolky oocyte surrounded by albumen, membranes and shell. Among the most successful reproductive management techniques are optimizing photoperiod, light intensity and nutrition. Widespread employment of these has allowed maximizing production. Laying hens can be re-cycled toward the end egg production. Other aspects of reproductive management in poultry include the following: artificial insemination (almost exclusively employed in turkeys) and approaches to reduce broodiness together with cage free (colony), conventional, enriched and free-range systems.",2020-12-31,"Scanes, Colin G.; Butler, Leasea D.; Kidd, Michael T.",Animal Agriculture,,,True,custom_license

These pathogens are transmitted, directly or indirectly, and can lead to epidemics or even pandemics. The resulting infection may lead to mild-to-severe symptoms such as life-threatening fever or diarrhea. Infectious diseases may be asymptomatic in some individuals but may lead to disastrous effects in others. Despite the advances in medicine, infectious diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, especially in low-income countries. With the advent of mathematical tools, scientists are now able to better predict epidemics, understand the specificity of each pathogen, and identify potential targets for drug development. Artificial intelligence and its components have been widely publicized for their ability to better diagnose certain types of cancer from imaging data. This chapter aims at identifying potential applications of machine learning in the field of infectious diseases. We are deliberately focusing on key aspects of infection: diagnosis, transmission, response to treatment, and resistance. We are proposing the use of extreme values as an avenue of interest for future developments in the field of infectious diseases.

The dynamical characteristics of an isolated population are preliminary studied, with particular reference to the equilibrium points and their stability. Then, the effects of constant inputs on the dynamics are deeply analyzed also by numerical simulations; this analysis is propaedeutic to the study of the interaction between the groups. The interactions between the different populations are modeled as additional input/output to the single group dynamics introducing total averaged effects including all the external migration effects. This approach focuses on the changes in the dynamics of one population when interactions are present without showing the global migration fluxes, but stressing the influences on each populations. Besides the simplifications of the model, this point of view may be fruitful also with respect of the design of control actions, assuming that each group can adopt the best control strategy for her/his own specific social characteristics. The epidemic case analyzed is HIV-AIDS. This choice has been made since this virus is present all over the world, but with different levels of dangerousness and number of infected patients depending on the economic, social, and cultural habits. The model used is a recently introduced one, which describes this epidemic spread considering two compartments of susceptible people, distinguished by the level of attention with respect to the virus transmission, one of the infected individuals not aware of their status, and two classes of patients, divided according to the level of infection. Additional inputs have been introduced to model fluxes of susceptible individuals and infected but not aware individuals.

Today, virologists are beginning to think of viruses as living organisms that can be classified phylogenetically into defined species, much like any other living organism. The primary reasons for this shift in attitude can be partially attributed to the discovery of giant viruses, having large genomes and complex regulatory systems. Aside from that, it has become obvious that viruses lead complex lives; they evolve, speciate, and participate in the evolution of all classes of living organisms. In this chapter, we will discuss the early attempts to classify viruses, and review the biologic properties of the classes of virus that contain human pathogens.",2019-12-31,"Berman, Jules J.",Taxonomic Guide to Infectious Diseases,,,True,custom_license

In some cases, infection may be just one biological event that occurs during a multievent process that develops sequentially, over time, and involves genetic and environmental factors that may vary among individuals. Consequently, the role of infectious organisms in the development of human disease may not meet all of the criteria normally required to determine when an organism can be called the cause of a disease. This chapter reviews the expanding role of infections in the development of human disease. We discuss prion diseases of humans, a fascinating example of an infectious disease-causing agent that is not a living organism. We also discuss the diseases of unknown etiology for which infectious organisms may play a role. In addition, this chapter reviews some of the misconceptions and recurring errors associated with the classification of infectious diseases that have led to misdiagnoses and have impeded our understanding of the role of organisms in the development of human diseases.",2019-12-31,"Berman, Jules J.",Taxonomic Guide to Infectious Diseases,,,True,custom_license

The vaccines have become a big challenge in the last decades, where the attention has been focused on scientific challenges such as new vaccine development and adjuvants or delivery systems. The classical vaccines were developed from live-attenuated or killed organisms, such as influenza, smallpox, and BCG, as well as subunits such as Hepatitis B. The attenuated vaccines carry the risk of regaining their pathogenicity under immunosuppression conditions. The development of subunit vaccines without risk are considered as an essential need in combination with adequate delivery systems to obtain desired cell and humoral immune responses against infectious diseases. In the last decades, the use of nanoparticles as a delivery system in vaccines has received special attention to improve vaccine efficacy. These nanoparticles could be composed of lipids, metal and nonmetal inorganics, several polymers, and virus-like particles, which have been tested in research; some of them have already been approved for human and animal use. The characteristics of the nanoparticles have allowed targeting desired antigen-presenting cells to improve immunization strategies to induce protection. The main characteristics of the nanoparticles are to protect the antigens from early proteolytic degradation, control antigen release, and help antigen uptake and processing by antigen-presenting cells, and they should be safe for human and veterinary use. In addition, the nanoparticles could be modified in their physicochemical properties to target specific cells and improve vaccine efficacy. This chapter focuses on the nanoparticle-based vaccine formulations and the approaches used to realize efficient delivery of vaccines in order to induce host protective immunity against infectious diseases.",2020-12-31,"Diaz-Arévalo, Diana; Zeng, Mingtao",Nanopharmaceuticals,,,True,custom_license

Shikimic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxy-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid), a natural organic compound, is generally utilized as a starting material for industrial synthesis of the antiviral oseltamivir, a drug against the H1N1 influenza virus. It is also an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of lignin, aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan), and most alkaloids of plants and microorganisms. Plant and microbial sources are the only sources of shikimic acid. Being a deadly viral disease, influenza causes the death of around half a million people each year. A neuraminidase present on the surface of the virus is the most important factor for viral reproduction by contributing to the release of viruses from infected host cells and hence the treatment of influenza can only be possible by neuraminidase inhibitors. The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or Tamiflu derived from shikimic acid pathway have been found to be potent influenza viral neuraminidase inhibitors against most influenza strains.",2020-12-31,"Priyanka Singh, ; Gupta, Ena; Neha Mishra, ; Mishra, Pragya",Phytochemicals as Lead Compounds for New Drug Discovery,,,True,custom_license

Biological filtration method of disinfection is the key step in centralized multistep and decentralized point-of-use water treatment system. A biofilm of indigenous microorganisms fixed on solid surface, called biofilter, is an eco-friendly and economic technique for removal of pollutants and pathogens. Stone, gravel, sand, soil, compost, mesoporous mineral stone, wood chips, etc., exemplify solid bed medium which provide enhanced surface area for microbial adherence and water retention. Slow sand filter (SSF) characterized by slow flow rate (0.1–0.2m3/h) and a biological layer over filter bed called schmutzdecke is fairly efficient in removal of coliform microorganisms such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, total coliform and fecal coliform, fecal streptococci, bacteriophage, and MS2 virus from wastewater. Rapid sand filter characterized by coarser sand and higher flow rate than SSF removes indicator microorganisms efficiently. Stormwater biofilter is popular and effective method for removal of pathogen and involves biological activity and physical retention of pathogen on filter media. Microbial diversity, inoculum size, pH and moisture of medium, temperature, and nutrient content are key parameters governing optimum performance of biofilter system. Therefore, biofiltration can be an efficient bioremediation technology for pathogen removal.",2020-12-31,"Maurya, Anurag; Singh, Manoj Kumar; Kumar, Sushil",Waterborne Pathogens,,,True,custom_license

Microorganisms from different ecological conditions and engineered microbes capable to produce versatile enzymes and bioproducts are added to native microbial population for in situ treatment of wastewater. Bacterial pathogen borne in wastewater is an important concern for public health because they are not only associated with environmental damage, morbidity, and mortality but also cause economic loss connected with physical and chemical methods in wastewater treatment. Bacteriophages are natural killer of bacteria; they can be used as an alternative, cost-effective, biological method for waterborne bacterial pathogen control. Legionella pneumophila is the most tracked waterborne pathogen requiring specific treatment conditions because despite of biocides use, they are able to persist in water supplies with the help of multispecies biofilms and phagocytic protists. This type of pathogens can be biologically controlled through native complex communities fight for nutrients by means of antagonistic molecules as war weapons. Bioinoculation of heterotrophic bacterial strains in different wastewater treatment systems improves the process of pathogenic bacteria removal.

Therefore, demands of animal protein consumption are increasing worldwide at an extraordinary rate. In order to meet the protein demand, intensive animal and aquaculture farming are considered. Like livestock farming (poultry, pigs, sheep, livestock, horses, rabbits, etc.), aquaculture farming (fish, crustaceans, mollusks, etc.) is also becoming the globe's emergent protein production sector. More than 580 aquaculture species are farmed worldwide. Current food animal and aquaculture farming are coupled with standard usage of antimicrobials. The antimicrobial drugs are major solutions for the management of contagious illnesses in food animals and aquaculture. In animal husbandry, antimicrobials are widely utilized for animal therapy, prophylaxis, or as growth promoters. Imprudent usage of these antimicrobials in food animals and aquaculture is a major contributing factor in the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The widespread use of veterinary medicines is considered to signify a frightening population health threat. It not only results in the disclosure and escalation of resistant microbes but also causes other individual, animal, and ecological deterioration. The contribution of resistant microbes from various sources seems to be the major base of resistance in the environment.

Particularly, how these systems can help people improve human conditions of health, by taking advantages of the new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), regarding early prediction and efficient treatment. The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review of the current literature available that focuses on information systems on syndromic surveillance using web data. All published items concern articles, books, reviews, reports, conference announcements, and dissertations. We used a variation of PRISMA Statements methodology to conduct a systematic review. The review identifies the relevant published papers from the year 2004 to 2018, systematically includes and explores them to extract similarities, gaps, and conclusions on the research that has been done so far. The results presented concern the year, the examined disease, the web data source, the geographic location/country, and the data analysis method used. The results show that influenza is the most examined infectious disease. The internet tools most used are Twitter and Google. Regarding the geographical areas explored in the published papers, the most examined country is the United States, since many scientists come from this country. There is a significant growth of articles since 2009. There are also various statistical methods used to correlate the data retrieved from the internet to the data from national authorities. The conclusion of all researches is that the Web can be a useful tool for the detection of serious epidemics and for a creation of a syndromic surveillance system using the Web, since we can predict epidemics from web data before they are officially detected in population. With the advance of ICT, Smart Healthcare can benefit from the monitoring of epidemics and the early prediction of such a system, improving national or international health strategies and policy decision. This can be achieved through the provision of new technology tools to enhance health monitoring systems toward the new innovations of Smart Health or eHealth, even with the emerging technologies of Internet of Things. The challenges and impacts of an electronic system based on internet data include the social, medical, and technological disciplines. These can be further extended to Smart Healthcare, as the data streaming can provide with real-time information, awareness on epidemics and alerts for both patients or medical scientists.

The origin of the viral ancestors remains controversial, the debate remains whether the viruses existed before their host cells, evolved as molecular structures that adapted to the intracellular development or of the cells that infected or housed them as hosts. The nature of the viruses could propose a hypothetical evolutionary model based on the way they parasitize cells and the way they fuse with their host cells. So far there are no “universal” viral genes that have not allowed the hypotheses of the “common viral ancestor” to be conclusive. Insects have a special role in understanding viral evolution and how they became pathogens, suggesting a coevolutionary scenario of colonization that would initially allow the survival of viruses and later an ecological niche required for the cycle of virus replication. The coevolution of viruses and defense systems of hosts represents a fundamental role in the evolution of both viruses and host cells, a kind of arms race between viruses and hosts, and the deescalation of that war could explain the coexistence of viruses and hosts. Viruses are playing an important role in the understanding of cell evolution and have earned the right to be included in the tree of life.

These newer genetically active agents have a major impact on the public health systems worldwide. Most emerging infections appear to be caused by pathogens already present in the environment, brought out of obscurity or given a selective advantage by changing conditions and afforded an opportunity to infect new host populations. Also on rare occasions, a new variant may evolve and cause a new disease. Altered virus transmission because of deforestation and environment change, ecological changes and agricultural development, commerce, technology, microbial adaptation and change, breakdown of public health measures, and deficiencies in public health infrastructure are the reasons for emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases in general and viral infections in particular. Specific factors precipitating disease emergence can be identified in virtually all cases. Moreover, these factors are increasing in prevalence. This increase, together with the ongoing evolution of viral and microbial variants and selection for drug resistance, suggests that infections will continue to emerge and probably increase and emphasize the urgent need for effective surveillance and control. These viruses are rich source of emerging diseases due to the introduction of infections from other species in the zoonotic pool. In the near future, there is an urgent need to monitor collaboration between human–animal interface so that public health risks can be understood. A number of activities increase microbial traffic from animals to humans or disseminate microbes from isolated groups into new populations and as a result promote emergence and epidemics. In some cases, including many of the most novel infections, the agents are zoonotic crossing from their natural hosts into the human population because of many similarities.

Alterations in the habitats produced by human activity result in global warming, climatic changes, which together with globalization, increased trade, the shortening of distances thanks to transport, the increase in population and the socioeconomic activities of human cause imbalances. In many cases the vectors and hosts have adapted to the changes and have risen to higher latitudes and altitudes, which could contribute to the appearance of outbreaks or new outbreaks of new arboviruses of public health importance. Different cohabiting species can be reservoirs or vectors of arboviruses such as alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Currently, some viruses transmitted by mosquito vectors, such as dengue virus, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus, have caused epidemic outbreaks with important effects on human populations. It is possible that the expansion of vectors and their diseases reaches developed countries such as the United States and the European Union with a great impact on public health. The clinical signs of the diseases produced by arboviruses can vary from nonspecific febrile syndrome, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, and even death.

Since then, almost 2000 cases have been reported from 27 countries, with Saudi Arabia being the epicenter. This newly emerging virus is highly pathogenic and has a case mortality rate of 35%. It is similar to the CoV causing severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in that both belong to the genus beta CoVs that are of zoonotic origin and cause lower respiratory infection. The natural reservoir for MERS-CoV remains unknown. Serological studies indicate that most dromedary camels in the Middle East have been infected with this virus, and they maybe the potential intermediate host. However, the mode of transmission from camels to humans is poorly understood. The majority of confirmed human cases have resulted from human-to-human transmission, most probably via respiratory route. Patients most at risk of developing severe MERS-CoV infection appear to be those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiac diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer. Unlike SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is considered an ongoing public health problem, particularly for the Middle East region.

It is a single-stranded positive-sense ribonucleic acid virus with 10,700 bases. The genus Flavivirus includes other arthropod borne viruses such as yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus. It infects ~50–200 million people annually, putting over 3.6 billion people living in tropical regions at risk and causing ~20,000 deaths annually. The expansion of dengue is attributed to factors such as the modern dynamics of climate change, globalization, travel, trade, socioeconomics, settlement, and also viral evolution. There are four antigenically different serotypes of DENV based on the differences in their viral structural and nonstructural proteins. DENV infection causes a spectrum of illness ranging from asymptomatic to dengue fever to severe dengue shock syndrome. Infection with one serotype confers lifelong immunity against that serotype, but heterologus infection leads to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever due to antibody-dependent enhancement. Diagnosis of dengue infections is based mainly on serological detection of either antigen in acute cases or antibodies in both acute and chronic infection. Viral detection and real-time PCR detection though helpful is not feasible in resource poor setup. Treatment of dengue depends on symptomatic management along with fluid resuscitation and may require platelet transfusion. Although vaccine development is in late stages of development, developing a single vaccine against four serotypes often causes serious challenges to researchers; hence, the main stay of prevention is vector control and management.",2020-12-31,"Murugesan, Amudhan; Manoharan, Mythreyee",Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens,,,True,custom_license

Viral emergence and reemergence, as a sanitary event, are only the visible part of the iceberg, while the hidden one corresponds to a multitude of complex and interrelated factors, including societal and environmental factors favoring the advent of the state of viral emergence and reemergence. According to the World Health Organization, 60% of the agents recognized as human pathogens come from the animal kingdom, and 75% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and reemerging animal diseases present a potential transgression of interface between interspecies establishing favorable conditions for genetic exchange leading to the emergence of new highly pathogenic variants and strains of which the animal is often the host reservoir. Therefore any public health prophylactic strategy requires a holistic approach to the health problem, taking into account the interaction between the triad elements of the human, animal, and environment. This globalized approach has been realized by the international community through the new recently established concept of “One Health, One World,” making the old bipolar concept of separated human and animal health issues avoided and obsolete. The extreme diversity of emerging and reemerging viral pathogens, the change of human lifestyle, the globalization of travel, business exchanges, and tourism potentiate the risk of emergence of highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases. Promoting intersectorial collaboration will allow to unify the health and safety policies.

IBV is well studied worldwide; nevertheless, in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions, epidemiological and scientific data are poor and not updated. In spite of regular vaccination with Massachusetts (Mass) strain has been available to control IB for many decades in MENA regions, which it is most commonly used, the protection is not occurred. However, the continuity of the spread of IBV has shown the emergence of multiple variant strains due to the frequent point of mutations and recombination events in the S1 gene hypervariable regions.

These viruses are released into the environment by various routes including water runoffs and aerosols. Furthermore, zoonotic viruses may infect humans exposed to contaminated surface waters. Viruses are emerging pathogens and are able to adapt by mutation, recombination, and reassortment and can thus become able to infect new hosts and to adjust to new environments. Enteric viruses are among the commonest and most hazardous waterborne pathogens, causing both sporadic and outbreak-related illness. While considerable research has documented the risk of enteric viruses to human health from contact with contaminated water, the current bacterial indicator-based methods for the evaluation of water quality are often ineffectual proxies for pathogenic viruses, but no correlation was established between the enteric bacteria and viruses studied. The present chapter will focus on viral pathogens shown to be transmitted through water. It will also provide an overview of viruses that had not been a concern for waterborne transmission in the past, but that may represent potentially emerging waterborne pathogens due to their occurrence and persistence in water environments. Monitoring effluents from wastewater treatment plants is important to preventing both environmental contamination and the spread of disease.",2020-12-31,"Bouseettine, Rihab; Hassou, Najwa; Bessi, Hlima; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens,,,True,custom_license

The chapter on “Bioterrorism, an Emerging Threat in Pakistan” focuses on the current situation of bioterrorism in Pakistan. Several examples from all around the world have been quoted to highlight different incidents of bioterrorism across the world. After addressing vicious epidemics, several laboratory methods for detection and surveillance for bioterrorism have been elaborated. The case studies of bioterrorism in terms of warfare highlight use of bioweapons at political fronts. Similarly, the success story of controlling bird flu and advent and persistence of dengue show the status of bioterrorism and Pakistan's preparedness to deal with this menace. Pakistan has strengthened itself to deal with bioterrorism by adopting different national and global tools for governance. However, the rapid decline in environmental quality leads to an increase in biohazards. It is important to address bioterrorism at every forum so that sustainable solutions can be devised to tackle environmental deteriorations.",2019-12-31,"Naeem, Zainab; Sohail, Nageen; Iftikhar, Shazia",Trends of Environmental Forensics in Pakistan,,,True,custom_license

Today, expert personnel and centralized laboratories are needed to afford much time in diagnosing diseases caused from pathogens. Recent progress in electrochemical studies shows that biosensors are very simple, accurate, precise, and cheap at virus detection, for which researchers find great interest in this field. The clinical levels of these pathogens can be easily analyzed with proposed biosensors. Their working principle is based on affinity between antibody and antigen in body fluids.

Sensors are distributed everywhere in smart cities. They can be employed to monitor health care, transportation, infrastructure, building, surveillance, government, etc. Especially, nanosensors hold great impact to turn the current techniques for the detection of viruses. With the facility of real-time sensing, there is no need for regular inspections for maintenance and surveying, which results in reduced costs and time wastage. Definitely, common sensing platforms need persistent updates to address increasing doubts in the detection of viruses as they modify quickly and spread from person to person, pointing the urgency of early detection. In this chapter the introduction is briefly described in Section 30.1. The fundamental of nanosensors is explained in Section 30.2. The significance and applications of nanosensors in virus detection are extensively discussed in Sections 30.3 and 30.4.

All molecules have “volume” and “mass.” Direct measurement of these fundamental parameters can realize label-free and real-time measurements. Nanomechanical sensors have been emerging as a key device for such label-free and real-time measurements with their multiple operation modes; static and dynamic modes for detecting volume- and mass-related features, respectively. A cantilever array sensor is a representative example among various geometries, while structural optimization can enhance the scope of nanomechanical sensors in both academic and industrial applications. One of the most advanced sensing platforms is a membrane-type surface stress sensor (MSS), which realizes both high sensitivity and compact system at the same time. The MSS is also expected to contribute to addressing nanomechanical behavior of living cells and their network.",2016-12-31,"Shiba, Kota; Imamura, Gaku; Yoshikawa, Genki",Biomaterials Nanoarchitectonics,,,True,custom_license

Semiconducting nanomaterials are attractive because their physical properties are different from those of the bulk due to the quantum-size effect. Also, they provide opportunities to study the effect of spatial confinement and problems related to surfaces or interfaces, which is important for chemistry. Recently, one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials, such as nanowires, nanobelts, nanorods, and nanotubes, have become the focus of intensive research owing to their potential applications in electronic, optoelectronic, electrochemical, electromechanical, and other fields. Further, various outstanding properties of NsM, such as optical absorbance, improved magnetism, and specific surface area, for efficient device fabrication have been summarized.

Newly available advanced nanomanufacturing techniques now allow very precise control of adjuvant particle size, shape, texture, and surface chemistry. Novel adjuvant concepts include self-assembling particles and targeted immune delivery. These individual concepts can be combined to create a single integrated vaccine nanoparticle-combining antigen, adjuvants, and DC-targeting elements. In the process, the concept of an adjuvant has broadened to include not only immune-stimulatory substances but also any design features that enhance the immune response against the relevant vaccine antigen. The modern definition of an adjuvant includes not only classical immune stimulators but also any aspects of particle size, shape, and surface chemistry that enhance vaccine immunogenicity. It even includes purely physical processes such as texturing of particle surfaces to maximize immunogenicity. Looking forward, adjuvants will increasingly be seen not as separate add-on items but as wholly integrated elements of a complete vaccine delivery package. Hence, vaccine systems will increasingly approach the complexity and sophistication of pathogens themselves, incorporating highly specific particle properties, contents, and behaviors, all designed to maximize immune system recognition and drive the immune response in the specific direction that affords maximal protection.",2017-12-31,"Barclay, T.; Petrovsky, N.",Micro and Nanotechnology in Vaccine Development,,,True,custom_license

To benefit from these advantages and at the same time overcome the disadvantages, a wide variety of nanoparticles are being actively studied for the development of peptide-based vaccines, in which the antigen either is loaded on the particle surface or is present within the particle. In this chapter, we will provide a brief overview of synthetic peptide–based vaccine research, with special attention on multiple antigen-presenting peptide vaccines. Further, we will introduce the current approaches for the development of nanoparticle-based peptide vaccines, which use well-characterized synthetic peptide antigens with facile chemical modifications (eg, attachment of lipid chain(s) or self-assembling peptide sequences). These modifications can be employed to induce peptide self-assembly into nanoparticles, which present multiple copies of peptide antigens on their surface.",2017-12-31,"Fujita, Y.; Taguchi, H.",Micro and Nanotechnology in Vaccine Development,,,True,custom_license

Most of the nasal vaccine delivery systems in the form of microparticulates, nanoparticulates, and liposomes are currently under development and prove to offer immunity in animal models.

A virus-like particle (VLP) expressed and purified from insect cells shares several properties with the virion but can be manipulated quite extensively through genetic engineering or chemical modification. This has exciting implications for exploiting the VLP as a nanocarrier for foreign epitopes or encapsulated deliverables. By exhaustively studying the structure of the virus, we have been successful in designing and synthesizing chimerized VLPs that either carry foreign epitopes, are capable of encapsulating foreign DNA, or both. Preliminary studies show that these particles provide specific and strong immune responses in mice when orally delivered. To appreciate the full potential of HEV VLPs, we have highlighted various properties of the virus with a strong focus on the VLP structure and the key features that make it suitable for oral delivery.",2017-12-31,"Holla, P.; Baikoghli, M.A.; Soonsawad, P.; Cheng, R.H.",Micro and Nanotechnology in Vaccine Development,,,True,custom_license

The CNTs can be single-walled, double-walled or multi-walled, depending upon the number of graphene layers from which a single nanotube is composed. The CNTs, favoring encapsulation of drug molecules or by possible attachment of theranostic agents on the nanotube walls, have enabled their use in controlled drug delivery, and in targeting of drug molecules to specific sites such as the lymphatic system, brain, ocular system, and cancerous tissue. This chapter provides an overview of various types of CNTs, methods utilized for their commercial production, and the functionalization approaches employed in drug-delivery applications.

The dynamics of transmission and the strategies for preventing infection transmission in health care institutions are discussed. Anesthesiologists have long been patient safety advocates and have taken on increasing responsibility for preventing health care–associated infections. Anesthesia providers practice in a nonsterile environment within the operating room and have an impact on bacterial transmission and infection rates. Understanding the characteristics of transmission elements provides the practicing anesthesiologist with methods to protect susceptible patients and themselves to avoid spreading infection. It is vital to have in place proper systems to remove contaminated air to minimize the risk of airborne pathogens being transmitted by children. Preoperative patient skin and other bacterial reservoir decontamination and hand hygiene by anesthesia providers reduces contamination of the work area and IV access ports. Hand hygiene is a well-known and effective solution to the problem of bacterial transmission within and across patients and is considered the most important and cost-effective individual intervention in the prevention of health care–associated infections in children and health care providers Compliance with the current “5 moments” World Health Organization guidelines could make a major inroad into reducing provider hand and workspace contamination. Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis is an essential tool to reduce the risk of postoperative infections, and the anesthesia team plays a central role in ensuring the proper timing of drug administration.

Detection of likely etiologic agents of respiratory infections can help direct management and can also play an important role in disease surveillance. For this purpose, we are still reliant on many traditional diagnostic tools that have been used for decades in order to determine the microbial etiology of respiratory infections. However, these tools have been increasingly supplemented by newer methods, particular molecular diagnostic techniques, which have enabled the more rapid detection of many pathogens that were previously difficult to detect. These advances have particularly lead to improvements in the ability to detect respiratory viruses and also other microorganisms that do not normally colonize the respiratory tract. Recognition of the existence of the lung microbiome has challenged the traditional views of pneumonia pathogenesis and may provide the opportunity for new diagnostic tools that are focused on more than just detection of specific known pathogens.

The laryngeal anatomy of young children makes them particularly susceptible to upper airway obstruction, and during acute infections this is exacerbated by inflammation and edema of the airway mucosa. The most common cause of infective upper airway obstruction in children is viral laryngotracheobronchitis, or croup, which is usually a mild and self-limiting illness, but management with corticosteroids may still be necessary. Bacterial causes of upper airway obstruction have fortunately become rare since the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae B (HiB) immunization, but a few cases of epiglottitis do still occur due to nonimmunization, vaccine failure, and infection with non-HiB organisms. These cases constitute a medical emergency due to the risk of rapid progression to complete airway obstruction. Other rare conditions are discussed including bacterial tracheitis, diphtheria, retropharyngeal, and peritonsillar abscesses. Key learning points in this chapter include the main discriminating factors of the various causes of infective upper airway obstruction, the importance of a calm and minimally distressing approach to the child presenting with stridor, and the need for early anesthetic team involvement in cases with a suspected bacterial etiology or signs of impending airway obstruction.",2019-12-31,"Balfour-Lynn, Ian Michael; Wright, Marie",Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children,,,True,custom_license

Most typically caused by respiratory syncytial virus in 70% of cases, the condition lasts for 4 to 7 days, with a prolonged cough in many. Children with comorbidity, particularly those born prematurely or with significant congenital heart disease, are at risk of more severe disease. Nasal obstruction progresses over 3 to 4 days to difficulty with feeding and increased work of breathing with hypoxemia. Crackles and/or wheeze may be auscultated. Apnoea may be a presenting sign in those less than 3 months of age. Viral load is highest at peak of symptoms and in those with more severe disease. Approximately 2% to 3% of all children are admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis. The differential diagnosis may include bacterial pneumonia, congenital lesions of the lung or heart, or an interstitial lung disease. There are no effective treatments, and admission is for feeding support (by nasogastric or intravenous fluids) or treatment of hypoxemia. Critical care support is required for some infants experiencing respiratory failure, though mortality rates remain unchanged. Practice within and between countries varies significantly and alignment of practice is a common goal of guidelines. Vaccines for RSV are in advanced development, as are several antiviral therapies for RSV. In most children, acute symptoms improve within 5 to 7 days and cough by 2 weeks. Recurrent wheeze is common following acute bronchiolitis and a good association with a diagnosis of asthma in childhood.",2019-12-31,"Cunningham, Steve",Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children,,,True,custom_license

Bronchiectasis is now again increasingly diagnosed, and its renewed interest has resulted in further in-depth studies in children and adults. However, diagnostic labeling of childhood bronchiectasis by radiology using adult-derived criteria has substantial limitations. Thus, pediatric-derived criteria are advocated. A paradigm presenting a spectrum related to airway bacteria, with associated degradation and inflammation products causing airway damage if untreated, entails PBB (at the mild end) to irreversible airway dilatation with cystic formation as determined by chest computed tomography (CT) scan (at the severe end of the spectrum). Increasing evidence suggest that progression of airway damage can be limited by intensive treatment, even in those predestined to have bronchiectasis (e.g., immune deficiency). Treatment is aimed at achieving a cure in those at the milder end of the spectrum to limiting further deterioration in those with severe “irreversible” radiological bronchiectasis.

This poses a significant challenge to coordinated international efforts in global surveillance and infection control. Significantly, respiratory viral infections, spread mostly via droplet transmission, are extremely contagious and have caused significant morbidity and mortality during outbreaks in the last decade. Molecular diagnostics via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been key in the rapid diagnosis of most of these viral infections. However, a high index of suspicion and early institution of appropriate isolation measures remain as the mainstay in the control and containment of the spread of these viral infections. Although treatment for most of the viral infections remains supportive, efficacious antiviral agents against influenza infections exist. The infections discussed in this chapter include those first described in the 2000s: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and metapneumovirus and rhinovirus C as well as those that have been described in the past but have reemerged in the last decade in outbreaks resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, including adenovirus, influenza virus, and enterovirus D68 (EV-D68).",2019-12-31,"Tambyah, Paul; Isa, Mas Suhaila; Tan, Christelle Xian-Ting",Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children,,,True,custom_license

The majority of severe episodes are triggered by viral colds. Unlike atopic asthma in adults and young people, the underlying pathology of this condition is poorly understood, and the label of “preschool wheeze” should therefore not be regarded as a diagnosis but a description of symptoms. It is important to consider other causes of wheeze, but, for the most part, serious conditions such as cystic fibrosis and foreign body aspiration are associated with atypical features on careful history and examination. There remain significant uncertainties about the optimal management of children with this condition. Short-acting bronchodilators are indicated for the acute treatment of wheeze, and current evidence suggests that daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy is an effective preventive therapy, at least in a subgroup of children. Some trials suggest that preemptive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids may be as effective as regular inhaled corticosteroids. Since wheeze is intermittent for the majority of children, preemptive therapy is a logical approach. However, more studies are needed to confirm whether preemptive inhaled corticosteroids are as, or more, effective than regular preventer therapy.",2019-12-31,"Grigg, Jonathan; Ducharme, Francine M.",Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children,,,True,custom_license

These are described classically via timeline with early infections (first month), middle (1 to 6 months), and late (after 6 months). Kidney transplant patients may suffer from infections secondary to a vast array of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Certain infections, particularly viral infections such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and BK virus, may portend acute and chronic implications of the infection and its subsequent impact on graft function. Critical care physicians and nephrologists caring for patients with a renal transplant must understand the broad array of possible infections, atypical presentations, and nuanced implications for appropriate evaluation and subsequent therapy, combined with the need for possible prophylaxis and/or suppression.

Fluorescent nanodiamond (FND), an inherently biocompatible and nontoxic nanoparticle, is well suited for such applications. We had developed a prospective isolation method using CD157, CD45, and CD54 to obtain lung stem cells. Labeling of CD45−CD54+CD157+ cells with FNDs did not eliminate their abilities for self-renewal and differentiation. The FND labeling in combination with cell sorting, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, and immunostaining identified transplanted stem cells allowed tracking of their engraftment and regenerative capabilities with single-cell resolution. Time-gated fluorescence (TGF) imaging in mouse tissue sections indicated that they reside preferentially at the bronchoalveolar junctions of lungs, especially in naphthalene-injured mice. Our results presented in Subchapter 1.1 demonstrate not only the remarkable homing capacity and regenerative potential of the isolated stem cells, but also the ability of finding rare lung stem cells in vivo using FNDs. The topical use of antiretroviral-based microbicides, namely of a dapivirine ring, has been recently shown to partially prevent transmission of HIV through the vaginal route. Among different formulation approaches, nanotechnology tools and principles have been used for the development of tentative vaginal and rectal microbicide products. Subchapter 1.2 provides an overview of antiretroviral drug nanocarriers as novel microbicide candidates and discusses recent and relevant research on the topic. Furthermore, advances in developing vaginal delivery platforms for the administration of promising antiretroviral drug nanocarriers are reviewed. Although mostly dedicated to the discussion of nanosystems for vaginal use, the development of rectal nanomicrobicides is also addressed. Infectious diseases are currently responsible for over 8 million deaths per year. Efficient treatments require accurate recognition of pathogens at low concentrations, which in the case of blood infection (septicemia) can go as low as 1 mL–1. Detecting and quantifying bacteria at such low concentrations is challenging and typically demands cultures of large samples of blood (∼1 mL) extending over 24–72 h. This delay seriously compromises the health of patients and is largely responsible for the death toll of bacterial infections. Recent advances in nanoscience, spectroscopy, plasmonics, and microfluidics allow for the development of optical devices capable of monitoring minute amounts of analytes in liquid samples. In Subchapter 1.3 we critically discuss these recent developments that will, in the future, enable the multiplex identification and quantification of microorganisms directly on their biological matrix with unprecedented speed, low cost, and sensitivity. Radiolabeled nanoparticles (NPs) are finding an increasing interest in a broad range of biomedical applications. They may be used to detect and characterize diseases, to deliver relevant therapeutics, and to study the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters of nanomaterials. The use of radiotracer techniques in the research of novel NPs offers many advantages, but there are still some limitations. The binding of radionuclides to NPs has to be irreversible to prevent their escape to other tissues or organs. Due to the short half-lives of radionuclides, the manufacturing process is time limited and difficult, and there is also a risk of contamination. Subchapter 1.4 presents the main selection criteria for radionuclides and applicable radiolabeling procedures used for the radiolabeling of various NPs. Also, an overview of different types of NPs that have so far been labeled with radionuclides is presented.",2018-12-31,"Wu, Tsai-Jung; Chiu, Hsiao-Yu; Yu, John; Cautela, Mafalda P.; Sarmento, Bruno; das Neves, José; Catala, Carme; Pazos-Perez, Nicolas; Guerrini, Luca; Alvarez-Puebla, Ramon A.; Vranješ-Đurić, Sanja; Ignjatović, Nenad L.",Nanotechnologies in Preventive and Regenerative Medicine,,,True,custom_license

ADEM typically affects young children, is often postinfectious, and is typically monophasic. MRI neuroimaging, which shows new lesions with poorly demarcated borders, but not old and established lesions, is essential to diagnosis. Autoantibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) are found in ∼40% of ADEM patients, and these patients have different clinical and neuroimaging features to seronegative patients. Treatment in the acute phase is typically with high-dose corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange for refractory patients. Outcome is usually good, but residual cognitive, inattentive, and executive issues are likely underestimated. In patients who have a relapse, biomarkers and imaging should help differentiate multiphasic ADEM, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, anti-MOG antibody–associated relapsing demyelination, and multiple sclerosis.",2018-12-31,"Sharma, Suvasini; Dale, Russell C.",Acute Encephalopathy and Encephalitis in Infancy and Its Related Disorders,,,True,custom_license

The possible etiologies of infection are diverse, ranging from common bacterial and viral pathogens that affect the entire community to opportunistic pathogens that cause invasive disease only in immunocompromised hosts. Antimicrobial therapies required to treat established infection are often complex, with accompanying risks for drug toxicities and drug interactions with the immunosuppressive agents used to maintain graft function. Rapid and specific diagnosis is essential for successful therapy. The risk of serious infections in the organ transplant patient is largely determined by the interaction between two factors: the patient’s epidemiologic exposures and the patient’s net state of immunosuppression. The epidemiology of infection includes environmental exposures and nosocomial infections, organisms derived from donor tissues, and latent infections from the recipient activated with immunosuppression. The net state of immune suppression is a conceptual framework that measures those factors contributing to risk for infection: the dose, duration, and temporal sequence of immunosuppressive drugs; the presence of foreign bodies or injuries to mucocutaneous barriers; neutropenia; metabolic abnormalities including diabetes; devitalized tissues, hematomas, or effusions postsurgery; and infection with immunomodulating viruses. Multiple factors are present in each host. A timeline exists to aid in the development of a differential diagnosis for infection. The timeline for each patient is altered by changes in prophylaxis and immunosuppressive drugs. For common infections, new microbiologic assays, often nucleic acid based, are useful in the diagnosis and management of opportunistic infections.",2019-12-31,"Fishman, Jay A.; Costa, Sylvia F.; Alexander, Barbara D.",Kidney Transplantation - Principles and Practice,,,True,custom_license

In addition to vaccinations and malaria chemoprophylaxis, a pretravel consultation should include advice on regionally endemic or emerging non–vaccine-preventable infections that can cause severe illness or chronic morbidity. These include mosquito-borne infections such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, and regionally endemic severe respiratory infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and some strains of avian influenza. Zika virus is notable given its capacity for sexual transmission and association with congenital birth defects. Preventive advice for other potentially relevant infections associated with specific exposures or activities (e.g., schistosomiasis and leptospirosis from freshwater exposure) should be provided where relevant.

Millions visit these areas, and each year thousands appear in hospitals with posttravel acute malaria. That diagnosis should be managed as a medical emergency. Illness may deteriorate rapidly without prompt diagnosis and effective treatment. Among five species of Plasmodium responsible for human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum most often deteriorates rapidly, but all species potentially threaten life. Malignant and benign species of malaria parasites is a dangerous fallacy. Clinical malaria mimics other common tropical infections and the diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation, but malaria-like symptoms in a patient exposed to risk should be presumed to be malaria until proven otherwise. Intravenous or intramuscular artesunate is used for severe malaria of any species in any patient, including all trimesters of pregnancy.

Although morbidity might be high, death during volunteer missions is not common and it is usually not attributable to infectious diseases. Medical evacuations are also not common. One unique aspect of ill-returning HAWs might be their threat to public health in their home countries, as was demonstrated in the 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

The aircraft cabin is pressurized to maintain an effective altitude below 8000 feet, which provides adequate protection for healthy travelers. Those individuals with cardiopulmonary impairment or other conditions affecting fitness to travel should seek advice from the airline in consultation with their medical provider. People are the primary source of microorganisms in aircraft cabins and are the most important reservoirs of infectious agents on aircraft.

The patient may present acutely with weakness, sensory impairments, or bowel and bladder changes. A careful history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic studies including blood tests and an MRI scan may help determine the diagnosis and etiology. Following the acute management, which may include use of steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and plasma exchange, a comprehensive medical rehabilitation program is important to optimize recovery from the resultant impairments and disabilities and manage associated complications. Complications such as paralysis, autonomic dysfunction, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain, spasticity, contractures, neurogenic bladder and bowels, skin breakdown, and psychological issues will benefit from the expertise of the physiatrist.

For safety, although disease transmission is a tangible risk, this possibility has been dramatically minimized through modern tissue-processing methods. These include steps to prevent processing tissues with unacceptable bioburden through rigorous screening using donor medical and social histories along with microbial testing of recovered tissue and viral testing of donor serum. Potential bioburden is also controlled through aseptic recovery and processing methods and then reduced through disinfection steps that can include antibiotics, detergents, mechanical process, chemical solutions, and terminal sterilization. Processing steps may also include decellularization methods to lower immunogenic potential of some tissues. To enhance fusion potential of bone void fillers, demineralization steps may be used, and the resultant demineralized bone matrices may be combined with a carrier to improve handling. Bone void fillers and osteochondral allografts may also be specially processed to retain a living cellular component. To preserve relevant biological, biochemical, and physical properties of allografts for clinical use and ease of handling, a number of methods may be used which include: (1) refrigeration in media, (2) freeze-drying, (3) cryopreservation, (4) freezing, and (5) media storage at room temperature.

Most of the world's population lacks access to accurate, affordable, easy-to-use, quality-assured, reliable, and accessible diagnostic tests and misdiagnosis of infectious diseases is common and compromises patient care. Laboratory diagnostics are also needed for the detection and surveillance of the increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance. Accurate clinical diagnosis in resource-poor settings relies strongly on the laboratory service, and the need to support the development of a quality-assured laboratory service in such settings is increasingly recognized. International organizations are actively working with local and national providers to improve laboratory services. The development of laboratory services will contribute to improved health for the local population, protection against emerging pathogens, and ensure better use of scarce health care resources.",2020-12-31,"Parry, Christopher M.; Peacock, Sharon J.",Hunter's Tropical Medicine and Emerging Infectious Diseases,,,True,custom_license

Disease is mostly limited to the upper airways and is self-limiting, but a small percentage can progress to lower respiratory tract infections as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Children and elderly people are at increased risk, especially in developing countries. The most important etiologic agents of severe lower respiratory illness are bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. Efficacious vaccines are available against the two bacteria and the influenza virus. Viruses are much more important in mild upper and middle respiratory tract infections and in bronchiolitis in children, whereas bacteria are the main cause of pneumonia, especially in adults.

Our civilization will continue to face the emergence of new pathogens and viruses: viruses will continue to evolve and adapt to new environments at a high rate; our population continues to grow through birth rate, land development, and migration; climate change will continue to increase the vector burden and spread and change the migratory pattern of animals; and our societal mobility will continue to increase through rapid transportation. The clinical evaluation of the febrile patient with a potential emerging viral pathogen involves documenting the likelihood for an infection by a detailed travel history, calculation of an incubation time by exposure, and an understanding of the disease progression though the clinical illness, which drives the differential diagnosis and the type of diagnostics ordered. Ultimately, the proper identification and diagnosis of a patient with a viral febrile illness due to an emerging pathogen will elicit the appropriate precautions to protect health care providers and communities, deliver appropriate therapeutic interventions, and initiate a targeted public health response.",2020-12-31,"Endy, Timothy P.",Hunter's Tropical Medicine and Emerging Infectious Diseases,,,True,custom_license

GAS has several mechanisms to avoid phagocytosis, including prevention of opsonization and the use of surface proteins to block complement fixation. The mechanisms behind the immunologic phenomenon are not well understood. Clinical presentations range from benign, short-lived impetigo or pharyngitis through to lifelong RHD.

In some cases, direct bat-to-human transmission has been confirmed. Lyssavirus infections transmissible to humans by bats include classic rabies, Duvenhage, European bat lyssaviruses, and Australian bat lyssavirus. Vampire bats (Desmodontinae) transmit classic rabies to humans and domestic animals in Latin America. Insectivorous and frugivorous bats are vectors or reservoirs of at least five Lyssaviruses species, Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg), Henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah), and some other viruses, bacteria, and fungi.

In the 19th century, antibodies from xenographic sources of polyclonal antibodies were used to treat infections (diphtheria). They were used often as protection from infectious agents and toxins. Complications related to their use involved development of immune complexes and severe allergic reactions. As a result, human source plasma for polyclonal antibodies became the preferential source for antibodies. They are used to treat infection, remove toxins, prevent hemolytic disease of the newborn, modify inflammatory reactions, and control autoimmune diseases. Continued improvements in processing decreased the transfusion/infusion transmission of infections. In the late 20th century (∼1986), monoclonal antibodies were developed. The first monoclonal antibodies were of xenographic source and were wrought with problems of immunogenicity. These forms of antibodies did not gain favor until chimerization took pace in the mid-1990s and in 1998 two monoclonal antibodies were approved one to treat respiratory syncytial virus and the other for breast cancers. Further development of humanized and then fully human monoclonal antibodies has led to an evolution of therapies with these agents. Monoclonal antibodies are being researched or approved to treat a multitude of diseases to include oncologic, inflammatory, autoimmune, cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, allergic, benign hematologic, infections, orthopedic, coagulopathy, metabolic and to decrease morbidity of disease (diminution of pain), modify disease progression, and potentially anatomic development. In this chapter, we will review the history of use of these passive antibody therapies, their mechanism of action, pharmacologic-therapeutic classification, particular medical indication, adverse reactions, and potential future use of these medications.",2020-12-31,"Pelletier, J.

The composition of a conventional virus can be described as follows. Centrally, the particle contains nucleic acid of varying quantity. This nucleic acid is either RNA or DNA but never both kinds simultaneously. Only certain non-enveloped virions can be crystallized. The availability of viral crystals has facilitated three-dimensional analyses by aid of X-ray diffraction. Through earlier studies, it has been possible to shed light upon the interaction between virus nucleic acid and capsid protein. A single-stranded nucleic acid can direct the synthesis of a protein that has a size corresponding to about 1/7 of its molecular weight. Nature generally utilizes symmetrical building principles in the construction of more comprehensive three-dimensional structures.

The orbivirus group consists of a large number of members, some of which are transmitted by vectors and, therefore, belong to the heterogenic arboviruses. Of the orbiviruses, the Colorado tick fever virus is the only one known to cause disease in man. As indicated by its name, the vector is a tick and the virus produces a febrile illness with myalgia. Arboviruses, that is, viruses borne by arthropod vectors and multiplying both in the arthropod and in the animal on which the arthropod is parasitic, show markedly variable morphological and biochemical characteristics.

The most serious medical consequences of viral pneumonia are encountered in the old, the newborn, or the patient with a circulatory or respiratory handicap. Influenza is a cause of increased mortality among the old, while RS virus is the most important respiratory virus infection in small children. Fever and a reddened sore throat are among the most common symptoms of infection, and are seen in association with many virus infections. The predominant number of cases of pharyngitis in children and young adults are because of virus infections.

Clinical food intolerance has many causes and many manifestations, including psychological aversion to the sight, smell, or taste of food as well as psychological intolerance to one or more of the many constituents of food. Dietary protein intolerance is the clinical syndrome resulting from the sensitization of an individual to one or more proteins that have been absorbed via a permeable mucosa in the small intestine. Intolerance to various food proteins, especially to cows' milk, has been recognized in children for many years. Such food intolerance may be the result of a variety of causes—for example, a congenital digestive enzyme defect such as sucrase–isomaltase deficiency or an acquired lactase deficiency secondary to small-intestinal mucosal damage, which in turn can be the result of a food allergy. The incidence of gastrointestinal food allergy diseases is greatest in the first few months and years of an infant's life and decreases with age. The acute syndrome is usually characterized by the sudden onset of vomiting, after cows' milk ingestion, occasionally followed by pallor and a shock-like state; however, acute anaphylaxis is rare.

Acute gastroenteritis is a very common diagnosis in pediatric practices. It is usually a clinical diagnosis. Its most common symptoms are acute vomiting and diarrhea. The most important acute complication of gastroenteritis is dehydration, which occurs when the child's overall output of fluid exceeds input. Insensible water loss is the volume of fluid that leaves the body as a result of the difference in vapor pressure between the skin and lung surfaces and the surrounding atmosphere. The small intestine is the organ principally affected in most children by gastroenteritis but the stomach and colon may also be involved to a varying extent.

Some live in dead organic matter and are called saprophytes. Saprophytes are important in industrial and agricultural microbiology. Saprophytes are responsible, for the ripening of cheese, the fermentation of carbohydrate leading to alcohol production, and the acidification of milk. In nature, bacteria are involved in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles. Thus, decomposition of organic matter is associated with the action of bacteria.

In the first, men were examined at intervals throughout their stay in Antarctica at Stonington Island, and their titers of specific antibody against a wide range of respiratory viruses were measured throughout the isolation period. The second line of study consisted of three clinical trials in which a dose of a known respiratory virus was given to a number of subjects. The clinical and serological responses and the spread of the organism within the community were observed. The results of these investigations were compared with those of similar trials in England carried out at the Common Cold Unit at Salisbury.

This chapter illustrates that a complex array of defensive mechanisms protect the lungs against the adverse effects of airborne substances and pathogenic organisms. In contrast to the adverse pulmonary effects of cigarette smoke and industrial pollutants, therapeutic agents remain a relatively minor cause of pulmonary toxicity in man although, actual incidence is difficult to ascertain. However, drug-induced pulmonary disease appears to be an increasingly frequent clinical problem and the drugs associated with parenchymal pulmonary injury in humans continue to increase. The development of drugs to be administered by inhalation or intranasal routes is particularly difficult because of the perceived risks of high local drug concentration in respiratory tissues, alterations to drug disposition and a potentially vulnerable patient population, often with pulmonary disease. Finally, the nasal chambers are the structures, which are first to be subjected to the effects of inhaled substances, whether microorganisms or chemical substances. Moreover, infectious agents cause inflammation in the nose and nasal sinuses, and this may be associated with inflammation in the conjunctiva, middle ear and oral cavity.",2000-12-31,"Greaves, Peter",Histopathology of Preclinical Toxicity Studies,,,True,custom_license

The major and minor salivary glands and their secretions also represent and integral part of the protective mechanism of the oral cavity, and derangement of saliva production may lead to loss of integrity of the oral mucosa. Drug-induced abnormalities of taste sensation are also well-described phenomena occurring in man although human studies are necessary for the detection of these effects. Inflammation of the oral cavity may involve the buccal mucosa, the gingiva (gingivitis), the tongue (glossitis), and the peridontal tissues (peridontitis). Therapeutic agents can induce inflammatory lesions in the tongue. Moreover, a protective layer of mucus, a visco-elastic material containing high molecular weight glycoproteins produced by the major and minor salivary glands, covers the stratified squamous mucosa of the oral cavity.

Among the viruses, those with RNA genomes tend to play a more prominent role, particularly among immunologically intact individuals. DNA viruses are also associated with respiratory disease. The characteristics of the viruses most often associated with respiratory disease are described briefly in the chapter. Three distinct types of influenza viruses are recognized, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and influenza C virus, based on antigenic differences in the nucleoprotein and matrix proteins. All three viruses share certain characteristics, including the presence of a viral envelope containing glycoproteins important for viral entry and egress from cells, and a segmented genome.

Emtricitabine represents one of the most potent anti-HIV agents identified to date, producing two log10 drop in viral load as monotherapy at a 200 mg qd dose as the affected individual became susceptible to opportunistic infections and specific immune deficiency resulting from the depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes. The clinical profile of emtricitabine discussed in this chapter demonstrated (1) a plasma half-life of 8-10 hours with linear kinetics, (2) an intracellular emtricitabine 5’-triphosphate half-life greater than 39 hours that supports daily dosing, (3) no significant drug–drug interactions that limits the use of emtricitabine in combination therapy, (4) comparable safety and efficacy to lamivudine, and (5) low incidence of Ml84V mutations. This important observation suggests that emtricitabine can increase the durability of oxathiolane nucleoside analog-containing drug regimens. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) constitutes a major worldwide health threat, as the clinical development program is just entering the pivotal phase. Emtricitabine can be an extremely important drug for the treatment of patients coinfected with HIV and HBV.",2003-12-31,"Painter, George R.; Rimsky, Laurence T.; Furman, Phillip A.; Liotta, Dennis C.; Schinazi, Raymond F.; Quinn, Joseph B.",Frontiers in Viral Hepatitis,,,True,custom_license

Available evidence demonstrates clearly that viral infection of the CNS results in a dramatic increase in chemokine gene expression. Moreover, production of chemokines in response to infection is highly focused within areas of viral replication early in the disease process and areas of viral RNA persistence during the chronic stages of disease. Resident glial cells are capable of generating a robust chemokine response following viral infection in the absence of inflammatory cells suggesting that this response may reflect an innate CNS response against viral infection analogous to the response of phagocytic cells in the periphery. Differences in virus and cellular tropism are likely explanations for the slight differences in chemokine profiles and duration of expression observed in the different models. The non-ELR CXC chemokine CXCL10 is often the predominant chemokine expressed early following viral infection suggesting an important role as a sentinel molecule in initiating neuroinflammation. Based on the studies presented in this chapter, it is clear that targeting chemokines during either acute or chronic viral-induced CNS disease may offer exciting new insights into potentially novel interventional mechanisms in treating human neuroinflammatory diseases.",2002-12-31,"Lane, Thomas E.; Buchmeier, Michael J.",Universes in Delicate Balance,,,True,custom_license

A concurrent problem is the fact that the standards prescribed by the law—which calls for quality, efficacy, and safety—are not as exact as they appear on paper. If the quality standards are set too low, the medicine may be ineffective or dangerous, whereas if too much is demanded, the work of making the medicine and checking the quality of every batch may be so laborious as to render it unaffordable. In various parts of the world, there is a considerable market of spurious and counterfeit products, many of which are of extremely poor quality.

A pharmaceutical corporation that wishes to meet its obligations to the developing world or to some chosen part of it should ensure the following formal legal obligations: (1) its products meet international standards for quality, efficacy, and safety, (2) the products are accessible, particularly in terms of price, (3) its research programs take account of third-world needs, (4) the information that it provides is adequate and dependable, and (5) its clinical investigations adhere to accepted standards.",2006-12-31,"Dukes, Graham",The Law and Ethics of the Pharmaceutical Industry,,,False,custom_license

In a program solicitation for proposals, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has attempted to address some of the perceived obstacles that biosensor development is facing.

Viral proteomics has included the analysis of viral particles to determine all proteins that compose the infectious virus, the examination of cellular proteins associated with a single viral protein in the hopes of determining all the functions of that viral protein, or the determination of cellular proteins induced or altered during a particular disease state. Viral particles of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV/HHV-8) have been recently examined. During the herpesviral replicative cycle, different viral particles are formed. For HCMV, this includes mature, infectious virions, noninfectious enveloped particles, and dense bodies. A proteome database of B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), before and after transformation, has been developed to identify the cellular mechanisms of virus-induced immortalization. 2DE is used to first separate proteins based on their relative charge (pI) and then based on their molecular weight. Proteomic analysis has provided a unique tool for the identification of diagnostic biomarkers, evaluation of disease progression, and drug development.

The first part addresses the many and not exclusive mechanisms leading to demyelination in the central nervous system. Although the hypothesis that a primary oligodendrocyte or myelin injury induces a secondary immune response in the central nervous system is still a matter of debate, most recent advances underline the influence of a primary immune response against myelin antigen(s), with a diversity of potential targets. Whereas multiple sclerosis was long considered as a T cell-mediated disease, the role of B lymphocytes is now increasingly recognized, and the influence of antibodies on tissue damage actively investigated. The second part of the review describes the axonal consequences of demyelination. Segmental demyelination results in conduction block or slowing of conduction through adaptative responses, notably related to modifications in the distribution of voltage gated sodium channels along the denuded axon. If demyelination persists, these changes, as well as the loss of trophic and metabolic support, will lead to irreversible axonal damage and loss. In this respect, favouring early myelin repair, during a window of time when axonal damage is still reversible, might pave the way for neuroprotection.",2014-12-31,"Lubetzki, Catherine; Stankoff, Bruno",Handbook of Clinical Neurology,,,True,custom_license

Increasing evidence suggests that the disease develops as a result of interactions between the environment and the immune system in genetically susceptible individuals. It has long been recognized that infections may serve as environmental triggers for the disease, and a large number of pathogens have been proposed to be associated with multiple sclerosis. Here, we detail the historical basis linking infections to multiple sclerosis and review the epidemiology of the disease, which suggests a possible relationship with infectious agents. We also describe pathophysiologic studies in animals and other human demyelinating diseases that have demonstrated a variety of mechanisms by which infectious agents may induce chronic, relapsing central nervous system disease with myelin damage and relative preservation of axons, similar to multiple sclerosis. In addition, we discuss recent studies in individuals with multiple sclerosis indicating enhanced immune responses to infectious antigens, though not consistently demonstrating evidence for ongoing infection. Taken together, these studies suggest a role for infectious agents in the development of multiple sclerosis. Conclusive evidence, however, remains lacking.",2014-12-31,"Venkatesan, Arun; Johnson, Richard T.",Handbook of Clinical Neurology,,,True,custom_license

In this paper we exploit Answer Set Programming to formalize and reason about uncertainty expressed as belief orders. The availability of ASP-solvers supports the design of automated tools to handle such formalizations. Our proposal reveals particularly suitable whenever the domain of discernment is partial. We first illustrate how to automatically “classify”, according to the most well-known uncertainty frameworks, any given qualitative uncertainty assessment.

There are many ways solutes are transported across the thin (~40 Å) hydrophobic barrier. Transport is divided into passive diffusion and active transport. A biological membrane is semi-permeable, being permeable to some molecules, most notably water, while being very impermeable to most solutes that require some form of transporter. Passive diffusion (simple and facilitated) only requires the energy inherent in the solute’s electrochemical gradient and results in equilibrium across the membrane. In contrast, active transport requires additional energy (i.e. ATP), and results in a non-equilibrium, net accumulation of the solute. Passive transport can involve simple diffusion or facilitated carriers including ionophores and channels. Active transport comes in many, often complex forms. Examples of active transport include primary active transport (uniport), secondary active transport (cotransport, antiport) and group translocation. Besides the multitude of transport systems, transport can be accomplished by Gap Junctions, receptor-mediated endocytosis, phagocytosis, pinocytosis, exocytosis and apoptotic membrane blebbing.",2013-12-31,"Stillwell, William",An Introduction to Biological Membranes,,,True,custom_license

The nitrosation of the sulfhydryl moiety leads to S-nitrosothiols with high and low molecular weight, respectively. The interest in the S-nitrosothiols was motivated by the observation that these compounds form in vivo and may elicit physiological responses that are strongly reminiscent of free NO radicals.

The threat of an agroterrorist attack depends on motivations and technical requirements of agroterrorism. Technical barriers to agroterrorism are lower than these to human-targeted bioterrorism. Terrorists' motives vary widely. The two most common are the profit motive and the anti-GMO (genetically modified organism) motive. The threat of an agroterrorist attack can be countered at four levels: (1) at the organism level, through animal or plant disease resistance; (2) at the farm level, through facility management techniques designed to prevent disease introduction or transmission; (3) at the agricultural sector level, through disease detection and response procedures; (4) at the national level, through policies designed to minimize the social and economic costs of a catastrophic disease outbreak.",2011-12-31,"Radosavijevic, V.",Encyclopedia of Environmental Health,,,True,custom_license

In this context, there has been some controversy regarding the appropriate way to define invasive species and the invasion process, given the widespread use of these terms in both scientific and nonscientific frameworks. Although scientists have not unambiguously identified tax-independent characteristics that define all invasive species, the invasion process itself has been observed to progress through the same sequence of stages regardless of taxonomic identity (i.e. initial establishment, expansion, and saturation). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment and spread of non-indigenous species in new environments. In the scenario of global change, species introductions and invasions are a major topic due to ecological impacts (e.g. changes in biodiversity), economic and social impacts (e.g. costs incurred for control or eradication or pests) and human health impacts (e.g. epidemics or increased exposure to hazards).

In the paraneoplastic syndrome, cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR), ARA with their targeted retinal antigens have been identified. There are many other infectious, inflammatory as well as degenerative retinopathies associated with the presence of ARA. More than 15 ARA have been identified in CAR. For these autoantibodies, the autoantigens still remain unknown. Recoverin, a calcium-binding retinal protein involved in the reversal of the phototransduction cascade, is well established as the most common CAR autoantigen. The proposed mechanism of antibody-mediated degeneration involves molecular mimicry and loss of peripheral tolerance to residing retinal antigens. In vitro, ARA have been shown to cause apoptotic death of photoreceptors. Questions remain though, regarding the access and penetration of these antibodies into the retina. Furthermore, the titer of ARA does not always correlate with clinical disease status. There exists lack of standardization of antibody and antigen detection. Thus, results from different laboratories cannot exactly be compared. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of pathogenic ARA is also lacking. Though there are many caveats, presence of ARA still serves as an adjunctive study for the clinician to confirm a diagnosis, which often is difficult to make. The study of ARA serves as an excellent model for the elucidation of pathological mechanisms underlying autoimmune retinopathy and its allied disorders.",2007-12-31,"JIRAWUTHIWORAVONG, GUY V.; LEVY-CLARKE, GRACE A.; NUSSENBLAT, ROBERT B.",Autoantibodies,,,True,custom_license

In preclinical safety studies, pathologies of the respiratory system can be a result of an intercurrent disease or can be induced by systemically administered drugs. Intranasal or inhalation modes of therapy pose particular challenges in terms of the formulations and technologies required to administer a drug. A complex technology is developed to support the assessment of adverse effects of inhaled substances in rodent and nonrodent species, and the extrapolation of experimental findings to humans. The nasal chambers are the structures that are first to be subjected to the effects of inhaled substances, whether microorganisms or chemical substances. In rodents, the relatively small size of the nose and nasal sinuses facilitates a histological examination. Findings show that infectious agents cause inflammation in the nose and nasal sinuses, and this may be associated with inflammation in the conjunctiva, the middle ear, and the oral cavity. It has been observed that a particular response of the rodent nasal mucosa to some irritant substances, including pharmaceutical agents, is the formation of rounded eosinophilic inclusions in the cytoplasm of sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium, and to a lesser extent in respiratory and glandular epithelial cells.",2007-12-31,"Greaves, Peter",Histopathology of Preclinical Toxicity Studies,,,True,custom_license

A significant proportion of therapy-related oral drug reactions appear to be lichenoid reactions, erythema multiforme, and bullous lesions similar to idiosyncratic or immune-mediated skin reactions. Inflammation of the oral cavity (stomatitis) may involve the buccal mucosa, the gingiva, the tongue, and the peridontal tissues. Stomatitis can be induced by systemic administration of high doses of therapeutic agents. Anticonvulsant drugs may also produce changes in the dentition of humans and experimental animals. Discoloration of the teeth and bone is a well-described adverse effect of tetracycline administration and it has also been reported in patients who were treated with the semisynthetic derivative, minocycline. Drug-induced overgrowth of the gingival tissues is a well-described phenomenon in both humans and laboratory animals, including dogs, cats, and rats. Sessile or pedunculated squamous papillomas and infiltrating squamous carcinomas are occasionally found in the oral cavity of most laboratory animals, including rodents, rabbits, and beagle dogs.",2007-12-31,"Greaves, Peter",Histopathology of Preclinical Toxicity Studies,,,True,custom_license

Pediatric inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are clinically heterogeneous with respect to their mode of presentation, clinical severity, rate of progression, and prognosis. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the CNS, typically transitory and self-limiting. The highest incidence of ADEM is observed during childhood. It is characterized by an acute encephalopathy with polyfocal neurological deficits. In the absence of specific biological markers the diagnosis of ADEM is still based on clinical features and MRI evidence of widespread demyelination, after ruling out other possible explanations for an acute encephalopathy. Over the past decade, many retrospective patient studies have focused on clinical and neuroimaging features, in an attempt to define specific diagnostic criteria. The occurrence of relapses in children with ADEM poses diagnostic difficulties in its differentiation from multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). With the widespread use of high-dose steroids, the long-term prognosis of ADEM with regard to functional and cognitive recovery is favorable. This chapter summarizes the available literature on ADEM in children, including the proposed consensus definitions for its monophasic and relapsing variants.",2013-12-31,"Tenembaum, Silvia N.",Handbook of Clinical Neurology,,,True,custom_license

Though medical applications remain the major area of application, biosensors are gradually penetrating a wide variety of non-medical areas. Earlier predictions indicated that the medical application was around 90% of the total biosensor market, which includes clinical applications for diabetes, cholesterol, and coagulation monitoring. However, medical applications of biosensors are now down to around 60%. These changes are atributed to the rapidly advancing technologies and to some serious business challenges. The biosensor field has expanded dramatically in the past 45 years or so since the first demonstration of a biosensor application in 1962. Self-diagnosis of blood glucose levels by diabetes sufferers, however, remains the dominant area of biosensor application. The increased investment in new laboratories is essential to permit the application research required for determining the commercial applicability of biosensors. Different trends and models for collaboration between different entities are being noticed at the present time. Some of these trends are presented here. Incubators are springing up wherein scholarly research at universities may be gradually turned into or groomed to becoming successful business ventures. In effect, the future expansion of biosensor markets will depend on the balance between market opportunities and technical and/or financial obstacles. Different examples of biosensor companies along with their product and what analyte it detects have been described. Most, if not all, of the examples have been selected at random to provide an overall perspective of the biosensors that have been or are in the process of being commercialized.",2008-12-31,"Sadana, Ajit; Sadana, Neeti",Fractal Analysis of the Binding and Dissociation Kinetics for Different Analytes on Biosensor Surfaces,,,True,custom_license

This type of classification is helpful for selection of lectins as structural probes in biomedical applications. This chapter summarizes the concept and the updated information regarding the specificity-based lectin classification. Lectins are functionally classified based on their relative binding reactivities with the structural units of carbohydrate or glyco-epitopes. They are grouped according to their monosaccharide specificities and then further sub-grouped based on their reactivities with more complex structures. Carbohydrate specificities of biomedically important lectins are classified into six groups according to their specificities to monosaccharides. The chapter introduces a practical platform of carbohydrate microarrays that is useful for lectin characterization and classification.

The relationship between nanoparticles and the environment is clarified from the viewpoint of the kind of influence nanoparticles generated either artificially or naturally have on the environment, such as in atmosphere, groundwater, wastewaters, and exhaust gases. Indoor nanoparticles originate from the several sources such as products of chemical reactions, nonvolatile residues (NVRs) of liquid droplets, printers/photocopiers, combustion, bioaerosols, and infiltration of outdoor air. The influence of nanoparticles on the indoor environment is discussed in the chapter. It describes the sources of nanoparticle generation in general industrial processes such as grinding processes, and in cleanroom or controlled environment industrial processes, such as exhaled air, ionizers, and haze by chemical reaction on solid surfaces. The chapter discusses safety issues related to nanoparticles such as possibility of dust explosion, health risks and biological effects of nanoparticle materials such as carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, nanosized metal oxides, and carbon black.

In these devices, named as ‘nanomechanical biosensors,’ a biomolecular interaction produces a change in the mechanical behavior of the transducer (a movement at nanometer scale), which can be measured and analyzed in real time. Microcantilevers translate the molecular recognition of biomolecules into a nanomechanical motion that is commonly coupled to an optical read-out system. This chapter discusses the main aspects regarding the physics of microcantilever as well the optical read-out techniques. It reviews the state-of-the-art, and discusses the prospective future directions of this new family of biosensors. Nanomechanical sensors are derived from the microfabricated cantilevers used in atomic force microscopy (AFM) and are based on the bending or resonance change induced in the cantilever when a biomolecular interaction takes place on one of its surfaces. The cantilever response depends on its mechanical properties, which are determined mainly by their spring constant and resonance frequency. Both parameters depend on the cantilever material and its geometry. The increasing number of applications of microcantilevers as biosensors has established these systems as a versatile platform for real-time and in situmeasurements of physical, chemical, and biochemical interactions. Further research is banked upon to provide information for increasing the biosensor sensitivity.",2008-12-31,"Alvarez, Mar; Zinoviev, Kirill; Moreno, Miguel; Lechuga, Laura M.",Optical Biosensors,,,True,custom_license

This chapter analyzes the detection of different analytes on microarrays/arrays/DNA chips and analyzes the kinetics of binding and dissociation (hybridization) in such biosensors through fractal analysis. Both single- and dual-fractal analysis are used to analyze binding (hybridization) of different targets (400 nM) in solution to a probe immobilized on a DNA chip surface, binding (hybridization) of different concentrations of free-DNA in solution to a 22-mer strand (bound DNA) immobilized via a phenylene-diisocyanate linker molecule on a glass substrate, SA-HRP (streptavidin-horseradish peroxide) in solution to a capture probe on a QCM (quartz crystal microbalance) electrode along with a detection probe, a complementary and a noncomplementary (three-base mismatch strand) DNA in solution to a 30-mer 30-thiolated DNA strand immobilized on an electrochemical enzymatic genosensor, binding (hybridization) of a perfectly matched oligonucleotide (ODN-P) and a noncomplementary ODN (ODN-N) to an electrochemical sensor with an EST2-A34 reporter. Fractal analyses are also used to discuss the binding and dissociation during PNA–DNA hybridization, PNA–DNA hybridization, and binding (hybridization) of different concentrations of ss DNA in solution preincubated with prehybridized 22-nt FQ duplex to a “broken beacon” immobilized on a sensor surface. Fractal analysis can be considered as an alternate method of analyzing the kinetics of binding and dissociation during hybridization in these types of analyte–receptor reactions occurring on biosensor surfaces.",2011-12-31,"Sadana, Ajit; Sadana, Neeti",Handbook of Biosensors and Biosensor Kinetics,,,True,custom_license

For many years, conventional virus isolation was the mainstay of viral diagnosis since it was sensitive and “open-minded.” However, growth in conventional cell culture entails an inherent delay that limits its clinical impact. Although rapid culture and viral antigen methods detect fewer pathogens and are less sensitive than conventional culture, both require less expertise and have greatly reduced time to result. Polymerase chain reaction has ushered in a new era in virology, especially in the diagnosis of neurologic diseases. Molecular amplification methods are rapid, highly sensitive, can be automated, quantitative, and detect viruses not amenable to routine culture. User-friendly, walk-away tests with results in an hour, as well as multiplex tests that can detect 20 viruses in a single reaction, are now a reality. As the variety of test methods and commercial products proliferate, the challenges for clinicians and laboratories are selecting which tests to utilize in which clinical scenarios, and understanding how to interpret the results.

Frequently individuals with influenza develop headaches, meningismus, and even seizures in addition to their typical respiratory symptoms. In the past decades, influenza viruses have also been associated with serious non-respiratory signs. The famous 1918 strain of influenza was associated with von Economo's encephalitis lethargica and postencephalitic parkinsonism. In the 1960s influenza virus infections in children were associated with Reye's syndrome characterized often by fatty non-inflammatory hepatic disease and an encephalopathy with marked non-inflammatory cerebral edema. Intermittently children with influenza develop focal myalgia and myositis. Guillain–Barré syndrome was epidemiologically associated with the 1978 killed influenza vaccine but not subsequent vaccines. Although occasional children with influenza have developed encephalopathy, from 2000 through 2004 there was an increase in the number of serious cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy accompanying infection with the influenza A 2009 strain. The current H5N1 strain of bird influenza occasionally infects humans with a high mortality rate and some appear to have central nervous signs.

Its clinical course in most cases is monophasic; however, relapsing ADEM is rarely seen, which poses a diagnostic challenge for distinguishing this disease from multiple sclerosis (MS). Although typically encountered in children, it also occurs in adults with disease characteristics slightly different from the pediatric cases. Formerly, ADEM occurred particularly often in children with measles. However, the illness most often follows a non-descript viral or even bacterial infectious illness. ADEM occurs throughout the world, and may even be more common in less-developed countries, where MS is rare, than in developed ones, where MS is common. Children seldom get MS as opposed to adults, indicating that ADEM constitutes a distinct entity from MS.

We present evidence implicating three distinct classes of infectious agents in the development of an autoimmune process within the retina. We highlight two human diseases triggered by Onchocerca volvulus or Toxoplasma gondii and an experimental model of retinal degenerative disease, referred to as experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR). Analysis of these systems revealed distinct pathogenic mechanisms involved in the induction of autoimmunity triggered by each organism. In T. gondii infections, the chronic reactivation is probably responsible for the presentation of sequestered retinal epitopes of the immune system. In O. volvulus infections, molecular mimicry between the organism and the human RPE protein may contribute to retinal pathology. In ECOR, differences in time of induction, duration, and intensity of innate immune reactivity may contribute to autoimmune reactivity in BALB/c mice.",2015-12-31,"Detrick, Barbara; Hooks, John J.; Nussenblatt, Robert",Infection and Autoimmunity,,,True,custom_license

There are a very large number of mechanisms in the visual pathway which could potentially be the targets of autoimmune attack. In practice it is the retina and the anterior visual pathway (optic nerve and chiasm) that are recognised as being affected in autoimmune disorders. Multiple Sclerosis is one of the commonest causes of visual loss in young adults because of the frequency of attacks of optic neuritis in that condition, however the basis of the inflammation in Multiple Sclerosis and the confirmation of autoimmunity is lacking. The immune process is known to be highly unusual in that it is not systemic and confined to the CNS compartment. Previously an enigmatic partner to Multiple Sclerosis, Neuromyelitis Optica is now established to be autoimmune and two antibodies – to Aquaporin4 and to Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein – have been implicated in the pathogenesis. The term Chronic Relapsing Inflammatory Optic Neuropathy is applied to those cases of optic neuritis which require long term immunosuppression and hence are presumed to be autoimmune but where no autoimmune pathogenesis has been confirmed. Optic neuritis occurring post-infection and post vaccination and conditions such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and various vasculitides may cause direct autoimmune attack to visual structures or indirect damage through occlusive vasculopathy. Chronic granulomatous disorders such as Sarcoidosis affect vision commonly by a variety of mechanisms, whether and how these are placed in the autoimmune panoply is unknown. As far as the retina is concerned Cancer Associated Retinopathy and Melanoma Associated Retinopathy are well characterised clinically but a candidate autoantibody (recoverin) is only described in the former disorder. Other, usually monophasic, focal retinal inflammatory disorders (Idiopathic Big Blind Spot Syndrome, Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy and Acute Macular Neuroretinitis) are of obscure pathogenesis but an autoimmune disorder of the post-infectious type is plausible. Visual loss in autoimmunity is an expanding field: the most significant advances in research have resulted from taking a well characterised phenotype and making educated guesses at the possible molecular targets of autoimmune attack.",2016-12-31,"Petzold, Axel; Wong, Sui; Plant, Gordon T.",Handbook of Clinical Neurology,,,True,custom_license

The dynamics of epidemic spread in large-scale populations are very complex. Further, human behavior, social contact networks, and pandemics are closely intertwined and evolve as the epidemic spread. Individuals’ changing behaviors in response to public policies and their evolving perception of how an infectious disease outbreak is unfolding can dramatically alter normal social interactions. Effective planning and response strategies must take these complicated interactions into account. Mathematical models are key to understanding the spread of epidemics. In this chapter, we discuss a recent approach of diffusion in network models for studying the complex dynamics of epidemics in large-scale populations. Analyzing these models leads to very challenging computational problems. Further, using these models for forecasting epidemic spread and developing public health policies leads to issues that are characteristic of big data applications.

The system comprises the ubiquitin conjugation machinery consisting of an enzyme cascade of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, the deubiquitinases (DUBs) and the proteasome, a multisubunit protease complex acting through an N-terminal threonine protease mechanism. A number of natural product inhibitors of the proteasome have been studied in detail and these inhibitors and their derivatives have been highly valuable in developing our understanding of this system. These efforts culminated in the successful development of bortezomib as a pharmacological agent used clinically as a cancer therapeutic in the treatment of multiple myeloma. This review is focused on natural product inhibitors of the enzymes involved in intracellular ubiquitin conjugation (ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, ubiquitin ligase E3) and ubiquitin deconjugation (DUBs). Members of both of these enzyme systems have been proposed as pharmacological targets for cancer therapy and several other diseases. Furthermore compounds with activities toward enzymes from the analogous ubiquitin-like (Ubl) protein families have been identified for SUMO and NEDD8. To date natural product inhibitors have been described for members of each of these protein families and were isolated from plant, fungal, animal, and microbial sources. Insights into the mechanism of action of natural products and their derivatives will enhance our understanding of this complex system and will improve our ability to rationally design novel inhibitors. The increased availability of assays and research tools for the study of protein ubiquitination, deubiquitination, and Ubl proteins will contribute to the discovery of more potent and selective compounds. We expect that these studies will stimulate development of further potential pharmacological agents in this area.",2016-12-31,"Hess, Wilfried; Mackeen, Mukram M.; Kramer, Holger B.",Studies in Natural Products Chemistry,,,False,custom_license

There are approximately a dozen members of this family, which are distinguished by their structure, their catalytic mechanism, and which proteins they cleave. Most of the members become activated at the low pH found in lysosomes. Cathepsins have been identified as therapeutic targets in the search for new drugs against a number of human pathologies, including cancer, Alzheimer's, and osteoporosis. A number of natural products have been reported as selective inhibitors of some cathepsins. Chemical structure of natural products as inhibitors of cathepsins can be very diverse. Some peptidic natural products are inhibitors of the cysteine protease cathepsins such as E-64 isolated from Aspergillus, which is a cathepsin B inhibitor, or more recently the marine cyanobacterial metabolite gallinamide A which is a selective inhibitor of human cathepsin L. Also amino acid derivatives have been reported as inhibitors of cathepsin A. Other natural products include chalcone natural products possessing cytotoxic activities against prostate cancer cells and inhibiting cysteine cathepsins in vitro, antipain and its analogues isolated from Streptomyces as inhibitors of cathepsin K, and natural biflavones as novel inhibitors of cathepsins B and K.

How do we maintain safety? What is reactive hazard? What is biohazard? Chemical transformation, or biotransformation, means change. Any changes have irreversible consequences. Managing the changes can help us, but changes can also be harmful. The first line of defense on any potential unwanted transformations is isolation or containment. WHO defines four risk groups of biosafety levels. There are six key knowledge bases for biosafety. With chemical safety, substance identification is the first step. The global harmonized system of classification and labeling is generally accepted by the world health safety bodies. The hazards are divided into three categories: physical, health, and environmental. Chemical reactivity hazard is a situation where an uncontrolled reaction could result directly or indirectly in serious harm to people, property, or equipment. Fire and explosion are common reactivity hazards. To safeguard processes and facilities, one needs to first identify the threat by screening for reactivity hazards. Combustion processes proceed with chain reactions and the reaction is highly exothermic. Combined with the high activation energy, combustion depends largely on temperature. The overall reaction products can also vary (partial oxidation versus total oxidation). Partial oxidation reactions are important in the chemical industry. Pyrolysis and gasification of biomass, for example, are useful technologies in biomass conversion. An explosion is a fast, transient, exothermic reaction. Unintended and accidental explosions can occur due to: (1) the accumulation of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) in confined space; (2) leakage of a “significant amount” of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) to the atmosphere or environment; or (3) reactor runaway.

These compounds have relevant pharmacological activities, such as: cytotoxicity against human tumor cell lines (especially leukemia), parasites (Plasmodium, Leshmania, and Trypanosoma), retroviruses (e.g., HIV), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Chemoinformatic and toxicoinformatic tools were used here to perform a computational analysis of 70 coumarins and 70 xanthones isolated from this genus in order to explore their potential as new drugs. Most coumarins from this genus possess similar patterns of druglikeness with differences in its physicochemical properties. Xanthones, on the other hand, show quite similar physicochemical properties and druglikeness. It is interesting to note that the vast majority of these compounds (57 coumarins and 59 xanthones) are in compliance with Lipinski´s Rule of Five. Remarkably, two xanthones (2-hydroxyxanthone and caledonixanthone-B) have leadlikeness potential that accordingly with chemoinformatic analysis may target MAO A and B, respectively, and therefore may exhibit antidepressant potential. These compounds also target tyrosine-phosphorilation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) which is over-expressed in a variety of hematological and brain cancers, therefore they could act as anticancer compounds. Several toxicological predictions were also depicted. Coumarins could be an irritant and may affect the reproductive system, while xanthones may have mutagenic results. To our knowledge, this is the first chemoinformatic report on the main active compounds of this genus and its potential for drug development.",2017-12-31,"Gómez-Verjan, J.C.; Rodríguez-Hernández, K.D.; Reyes-Chilpa, R.",Studies in Natural Products Chemistry,,,True,custom_license

It first spread within Guangdong Province and then to other parts of China. Via air travelers, it quickly reached various countries around the globe, causing several major hospital outbreaks. Within weeks, the causative agent, a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified, thanks to an unprecedented international effort led by the World Health Organization (WHO). Its origin was quickly traced to wild animals traded locally for culinary purposes. Masked palm civet and some other species seem to have acted as intermediate hosts. Since then, SARS-like coronaviruses were found in different bat species in China and elsewhere, and bats are now regarded as the wildlife reservoir for SARS-CoV. Fortunately, the SARS outbreak could be contained within months. Until July 2003, it had caused 8096 cases, with 774 deaths. Once adequate measures such as isolating patients and quarantining their contacts were strictly adhered to, further transmission between human beings could be interrupted.

This initial section is split chronologically into the early neonatal and infantile period and later childhood and adulthood; with the intention of reflecting clinical practice as closely and succinctly as possible. Disorders of the biliary tree, bile formation and secretion, and hepatocyte metabolism are the core of this chapter, a merger of chapters 3 and 4 of the previous edition. Considerations on the pathogenetic and/or clinical overlap between developmental, genetic and metabolic disorders were the rationale behind this change. The complexity of hepatocyte metabolism is reflected into the miriad of related pathological conditions. Recent technological advances, particularly in genomics in the last five years, have resulted in a plethora of new entities and changes in terminology, challenging the authors to balance detail and application to clinical practice. Tables and figures from previous editions have been largely kept due to their quality and contemporary relevance, whilst new ones have been added to accommodate new advances (e.g. classification of mitochondrial disorders), a compromise to bridge between the two editions for the accustomed reader. Liver involvement in immunodeficiency and miscellaneous disorders precede the final section on anatomical anomalies.

Unravelling the intricacies of immune defenses against viruses should lead to improved control of infections through the design of new vaccines and therapies. Our understanding of the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the immune systems response to virus infection has improved substantially in recent years. This wealth of new information and the promise of new insight from systems biology approaches continue to drive research in this field. Such knowledge has revealed why viruses sometimes induce immune dysfunction or trigger disastrous pathology and has paved the way for new therapies being tested against chronic and emerging infections. In this chapter, we briefly summarize the general concepts in immunity to virus infections and highlight some of the key challenges remaining for the future.

During early infancy, innate as well as adaptive immune cells are immature, immune memory has not been built, and regulatory pathways that maintain tolerance dominate. Throughout life, the adult human systems face the challenge of maintaining immune cell and population homeostasis while facing declining regenerative capacity and constant exogenous assaults. Failure of homeostatic mechanisms, together with age-acquired cellular defects, leads to the complex embodiment of immunosenescence that combines ineffective immune responses to infection and vaccination with constitutive production of inflammatory mediators and increased risk of autoimmunity.",2019-12-31,"Goronzy, Jӧrg J.; Gustafson, Claire E.; Weyand, Cornelia M.",Clinical Immunology,,,True,custom_license

Deep water collections have been made by dredging and trawling. These are both cost-effective collection methods if the substratum does not cause damage to or snag the gear. There are several disadvantages to these approaches. It is difficult to photograph the organisms in their habitat, and encrusting organisms or organisms that grow in crevices, under ledges, or on steep rock faces cannot be easily collected unless the hard substrate that supports the organism is collected as well; dredging and trawling put all collected samples in close contact with each other and therefore, some organisms may chemically contaminate others because of exudations or secretions of various compounds and the environmental impact of dredging or trawling can be detrimental because the sampling is nonselective and habitats can be damaged or destroyed. A controversial facet of marine-derived microorganisms is their putative role with respect to the origin of bioactive natural products from marine macroorganism–microorganisms associations. Symbiotic microorganisms have been repeatedly suggested as being the direct or indirect sources of bioactive metabolites in marine sponges and other invertebrates, tunicates, and bryozoans.",1994-12-31,"Oliver, J.McConnell; Ross, E.Longley; Frank, E.Koehn",Discovery of Novel Natural Products with Therapeutic Potential,,,True,custom_license

Carbon nanostructures span the same length scale as bio-compounds, ranging from subnanometer-size nucleotides to tens and hundreds of nanometer-sized organelles and viruses, and up to micron-sized cell sizes. The chapter also summarizes different approaches to the surface functionalization of nanodiamonds (ND) particles—that is, the key in successful biomedical applications followed by a discussion of modification of diamond surfaces with nucleic acids and proteins.

The fascinating and unparalleled properties of electrospun nanomaterials, such as large surface-to-volume ratios and high open porosity, have opened new and unexpected fields of application, especially in ultrasensitive sensors. By exploiting the inherent physical, electrical and mechanical properties of nanomaterials, it is possible to improve the performance of conventional sensors by increasing their sensitivity, selectivity, portability and power efficiency. In this chapter, the recent progress in the development of electrospun nanomaterials is reviewed. In particular, applications in some predominant sensing approaches, such as acoustic wave, resistive, photoelectric, optical and biological, are discussed.",2012-12-31,"Wang, X.F.; Ding, B.; Yu, J.Y.",Functional Nanofibers and their Applications,,,True,custom_license

Viral diseases have low fatality rates but transmission to humans via food is important due to the high probability of consuming fecally contaminated food or water because of poor food handling. Because of the low infectious doses of some foodborne viruses, there is a need for standardization and the development of new sensitive methods for detecting viruses.

Hospital pathogens such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), norovirus, multi-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and Clostridium difficile persist in the healthcare environment for considerable lengths of time. Cleaning with both detergent and disinfectant-based regimens help control these pathogens in both routine and outbreak situations. The most important transmission risk comes from organisms on frequently handled items because hand contact with a contaminated site could deliver a pathogen to a patient. Cleaning practices should be tailored to clinical risk, near-patient areas and hand-touch-sites and scientifically evaluated for all surfaces and equipment in today’s hospitals.",2014-12-31,"Dancer, S.J.",Decontamination in Hospitals and Healthcare,,,True,custom_license

The most commonly used systems are hydrogen peroxide vapour (H2O2 vapour), aerosolised hydrogen peroxide (aHP) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. These systems have important differences in their active agent, delivery mechanism, efficacy, process time and ease of use. The choice of NTD system should be influenced by the intended application, the evidence base for effectiveness, practicalities of implementation and cost constraints.",2014-12-31,"Otter, J.A.; Yezli, S.; Perl, T.M.; Barbut, F.; French, G.L.",Decontamination in Hospitals and Healthcare,,,True,custom_license

Most crocodilians grow to be larger than other reptile species and, therefore, have significant space requirements. Like most animals requiring an aquatic environment, crocodilians need water that is clean and free of disease. Crocodilians have a true hard palate in the roof of the mouth that ends caudally in a soft palate. This soft palate has a ventral flap which is referred to as the velum palati. The respiratory system of crocodilians consists of well-developed lungs benefiting from a very effective inspiration aided by the intercostal muscles and the septum post hepaticum. Crocodilians have a four-chambered heart as opposed to the three-chambered heart found in other reptiles and amphibians. The temperature and humidity requirements for crocodilians in captivity vary with the species. An understanding of crocodilian biology and natural history is needed to try and duplicate their natural environment. An important consideration is the allowance of circadian variations in light cycle and temperatures to mimic their natural environment. This is not the case in many commercial operations, where they are maintained at a fairly constant temperature and humidity to achieve faster growth.",2009-12-31,"Nevarez, Javier",Manual of Exotic Pet Practice,,,True,custom_license

Mice are continuous, polyestrous rodents that should be bred in polygamous or monogamous setups because of the males' aggressive territoriality behavior. When breeding mice that have been housed in a polygamous ratio, there may be one male with two to six females. Females are removed from a polygamous cage before parturition, whereas the monogamous pair is maintained together with the young until weaning. Mice are maintained in environments that are similar to other small rodents but require a thorough cleaning of their cage more often because of their malodorous urine. Ventilation is essential for small rodent housing to prevent irritation of the respiratory tract from ammonia vapors generated by urine. Quarantining is important when a new animal is being introduced into a setting in which there is an established group. As with other animals, a 30-day quarantine period is recommended, along with a physical examination and fecal parasite check. To maintain oversight of breeding animals' health and reduce the exposure of young animals to infectious disease and parasites, routine screening of representative animals within the colony is recommended. In very large colonies, special caging, food, and water may be necessary to prevent exposure to disease organisms.",2009-12-31,"Tully, Thomas N.",Manual of Exotic Pet Practice,,,True,custom_license

Ferrets have a long, slender body with short muscular legs, a long thin tail, small eyes, and short ears. The life span of the ferret is 5 to 8 years. Ferrets may be housed singly or in groups, inside or outside of a house. When kept outdoors, however, they must be protected from extreme weather. Ferrets have difficulty tolerating temperatures above 90°F or below 20°F, and appropriate precautions must be taken to prevent their exposure to these extremes. Ferrets are carnivorous and require a suitable diet. A diet that is high in good-quality animal protein and fat and low in complex carbohydrates and fiber is recommended. Ferrets are routinely immunized against canine distemper virus (CDV) and rabies virus. Ferrets are quite susceptible to CDV, and there is a 100% mortality rate in unvaccinated ferrets infected with CDV. When a new ferret is brought into the household, a quarantine period is recommended before introducing it to other animals, particularly other ferrets. The purpose of the quarantine period is to identify and prevent transmission of infectious disease potentially carried by the new ferret. The duration of this period allows for the development of any clinical signs in a seemingly healthy ferret following entrance into the new household.",2009-12-31,"Wolf, Tiffany M.",Manual of Exotic Pet Practice,,,True,custom_license

There are about 50 different breeds of domestic rabbits. Rabbits have very thin and delicate skin that is covered with fine fur comprised of both a soft undercoat and stiff guard hairs. Care must be taken when clipping fur because the skin is prone to tearing. A rabbit enclosure should be large enough to provide a sleeping space, eating space, and latrine. Animals housed for long periods of time should also have ample room to exercise. The enclosure should be tall enough to allow the rabbit to sit up and not have its ears touch the top of the cage. Because rabbits are prone to heatstroke, they should be housed in temperatures ranging from 60°F to 75°F. If rabbits are housed outdoors, they must have access to shade and clean water, and the shelter should protect them from the elements as well as from predators. The ideal substrate for rabbits is grass hay; however, for indoor, caged rabbits, a foam rubber pad or a towel covered with newspaper and a thick layer of timothy hay can also be used.",2009-12-31,"Vennen, Kristine M.; Mitchell, Mark A.",Manual of Exotic Pet Practice,,,True,custom_license

Guinea pigs have wide bodies with short limbs. They have a short, flat nose, laterally placed eyes, and hairless external pinnae. The dentition of the guinea pig is described as aradicular hypsodont. Guinea pigs are best housed in well-ventilated, wire-sided cages with solid bottoms. If housed indoors, guinea pig enclosures do not require a cover, as these animals do not typically jump or climb. Heavy food containers are recommended to make dumping of the receptacle more difficult. All food containers should be easy to disinfect and should be cleaned regularly, because guinea pigs have a habit of soiling their food bowls. These animals, native to the Andes Mountains, are very susceptible to hyperthermia and should never be housed in temperatures greater than 80°F. High humidity can also exacerbate a guinea pig's sensitivity to elevated temperatures by increasing the heat index. Guinea pigs often do not exhibit clinical signs early in a disease process. Therefore, a thorough physical examination can be extremely useful in determining the overall health status of the animal.",2009-12-31,"Riggs, Shannon M.",Manual of Exotic Pet Practice,,,True,custom_license

There are many financial, ethical, and emotional issues for veterinarians to consider when deciding whether to accept wildlife cases to their practice. Wildlife is not owned and, therefore, does not come with paying caretakers. In many cases, the hospital will be expected to absorb the cost of treatment, although avenues for monetary compensation, including grants and public donations, do exist. Accepting wildlife cases is often perceived by (prospective) clients as a positive reinforcement of a veterinarian's compassion toward animals and can serve, directly or indirectly, as a method of increasing a veterinarian's domestic and exotic pet caseload. One ethical consideration to make with these cases is deciding when intervention may interfere with a natural process occurring in a population. The potential costs of accepting wildlife cases usually include expenses associated with captivity, treatment, release, and failure to reestablish the animal in the wild, as well as the welfare risks to conspeciﬁcs and other species through the possible introduction of infection or competition for resources and the upset in natural selection (for example, treating animals that have increased susceptibility to disease may inadvertently select for less ﬁt animals). The potential benefits associated with working with these animals include the emotional pleasure humans derive from helping a “lesser” species, the potential to educate the public, and the opportunities this type of medicine provides for monitoring threats to wildlife and human populations.",2009-12-31,"Bewig, Maya; Mitchell, Mark A.",Manual of Exotic Pet Practice,,,True,custom_license

CAP is a common and potentially serious illness, particularly in elderly patients and those with significant comorbidities. CAP may be caused by myriad pathogens, but bacteria are the most common causes. Bacteria have traditionally been divided into two groups: typical and atypical agents. Typical organisms include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, Moraxella catarrhalis, anaerobes, and aerobic gram-negative bacteria. Atypical organisms include Legionella species, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila (also known as Chlamydia) pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila psittaci. This chapter will focus on the general approach to CAP in adults, with a concentration primarily on typical bacterial causes. Other chapters focus specifically on pneumonia caused by aspiration, viruses, or atypical organisms.",2012-12-31,"File, Thomas M.",Netter’s Infectious Diseases,,,True,custom_license
4201,,Elsevier,33 Pharyngitis,10.1016/B978-1-4377-0126-5.00033-1,,,els-covid,"Abstract “Sore throat” or pharyngitis is one of the most frequent complaints of patients in the acute care setting, accounting for nearly 7 million pediatric and 6 million adult visits each year. On the surface, pharyngitis would appear to pose few challenges to the clinician; the site of infection is both visible and accessible for inspection and culture, and the majority of pharyngeal pathogens are self-limiting respiratory viruses. Unfortunately, the diagnosis and management of acute pharyngitis is complicated by the 10% to 30% of cases caused by bacterial pathogens, particularly group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS). Concerns over the risk of suppurative and nonsuppurative complications associated with GAS pharyngitis have fueled the widespread practice of empirical antimicrobial therapy. However, the consequences of antimicrobial overuse, measured by cost, adverse events, and bacterial resistance, have refocused attention on the need for targeted therapy based on an appreciation of the epidemiology and diverse clinical presentations of acute pharyngitis.",2012-12-31,"Bower, John R.",Netter’s Infectious Diseases,,,False,custom_license

By July 2003, the global outbreak was declared over. A new coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the causative agent; this virus appeared to have a zoonotic origin, as genetically similar coronaviruses have been identified in several animal species. The global response to the outbreak was extensive. Within a short period, the pathogen had been identified, new diagnostic tests were developed, surveillance systems were created, infection control and prevention measures were instituted, and transmission among humans stopped. It is unclear if and when person-to-person SARS-CoV transmission will reappear. However, procedures have been established by public health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to help guide diagnosis, reporting, surveillance, and prevention.",2012-12-31,"Schneider, Eileen",Netter’s Infectious Diseases,,,True,custom_license

This chapter addresses the broad health concerns of those two groups, followed by discussion on parasites, infectious diseases, and vaccination, and concludes with suggestions for chemical restraint and anaesthesia of red pandas. Several drugs and drug combinations have been used to chemically restrain red pandas for short procedures or for the induction of general anaesthesia. Neonates are usually “masked down,” by placing a face mask over their face, and having them breathe 5% isoflurane in oxygen. Alternatively, an induction chamber can be used in all age groups. Anaesthesia is induced by flowing 5% isoflurane in oxygen into the box. A combination of ketamine HCl, a dissociative anaesthetic and medetomidine, an alpha-2-adrenergicagonist works well in red pandas for short, non-noxious procedures, such as blood collection, teeth cleaning, orradiology. Typically, the animal is transferred from a crate to a small squeeze cage and the drugs are given intramuscularly, via hand injection. The effects of the medetomidine can be reversed with atipamezole and recoveries are usually rapid and smooth. Other drug combinations that have been used in juvenile and adult red pandas are: ketamine and xylazine; ketamine with xylazine i.m. and followed by i.v. diazepam; and tiletamine/zolazepam.",2011-12-31,"Philippa, Joost; Ramsay, Ed",Red Panda,,,True,custom_license

The method is based on the affinity of microbes for hydrocarbons which are digested, producing harmless carbon dioxide, water and soluble fatty acids. The microbes are nonpathogenic and are safe to handle and dispose. The process is environmentally friendly and is less expensive than solvent cleaning, but it is not applicable to high precision cleaning applications. Typical applications include parts washing; oil and grease removal from concrete and other floor surfaces, and from drains and grease traps; cleaning and disinfection in healthcare facilities; cleaning of historical artworks and structures; and household and institutional cleaning applications.",2013-12-31,"Kohli, Rajiv",Developments in Surface Contamination and Cleaning,,,True,custom_license

Pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and endospores are described along with other infectious agents. The processes for controlling these infectious agents in food are summarized. These processes include not only irradiation by the two most important processes, electron beam and gamma ray, but by other processes such as ultraviolet, microwave, and infrared radiation. Medical sterilization and disinfectant processes are reviewed. Besides irradiative processes, thermal processes such as steam autoclave and dry heat are reviewed. Many liquid and gaseous chemical disinfectants are covered. The commercially important ethylene oxide sterilization process is discussed. Dealing with bioterrorism agents is briefly discussed. Throughout this chapter, the mechanisms, the irradiation, sterilization, and chemical disinfectant processes used to destroy the pathogens are discussed often in chemical detail.",2012-12-31,"McKeen, Laurence",The Effect of Sterilization on Plastics and Elastomers,,,True,custom_license

Tissue engineering has generated much interest from researchers in many fields, including cell and molecular biology, biomedical engineering, transplant medicine, and organic chemistry. Attempts to build tissues or organs in vitro have utilized both scaffold and scaffold-free approaches. Despite considerable progress, fabrication of three-dimensional tissue constructs in vitro remains a challenge.

The potential to control oral biofilms through the use of nanoparticles, classified as particles having a size no greater than 100nm, is reviewed in this chapter. Exploitation of the toxic properties of nanoparticles to bacteria, viruses, and fungi, in particular metals and metal oxides and their incorporation into other materials has increased markedly over the past decade. The potential of nanoparticles to control the formation of biofilms within the oral cavity, as a function of their antimicrobial, antiadhesive, and delivery capabilities, is now coming under close scrutiny. Formulation of materials at the nanoscale range does require novel physicochemical and technological approaches.

Surface-engineered bacteria, in turn, have proven useful in a variety of settings, including high-throughput screening, biofuel production, and vaccinology. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review of methods for displaying polypeptides and sugars on the bacterial cell surface, and discuss the many innovative applications these methods have found to date. While already an important biotechnological tool, we believe bacterial surface display may be further improved through integration with emerging methodology in other fields, such as protein engineering and synthetic chemistry. Ultimately, we envision bacterial display becoming a multidisciplinary platform with the potential to transform basic and applied research in bacteriology, biotechnology, and biomedicine.",2014-12-31,"Gautam, Samir; Spiegel, David A.",Micro- and Nanoengineering of the Cell Surface,,,True,custom_license

The term “nanotechnology” is now commonly used to refer to the creation of new objects with nanoscale dimensions between 1 and 100nm. Functionalities can be added to nanomaterials by interfacing them with biological molecules or structures. The integration of nanomaterials with biology has led to the development of diagnostic devices, contrast agents, analytical tools, and drug delivery vehicles. Many diseases that do not have a cure today may be cured by nanotechnology in the future. Nanoscience does have an impact on several areas of microbiology. It allows for the study and visualization at the molecular assembly level of a biological process. More studies are needed to determine the environmental and health risks associated with nanomaterials. The current cross-disciplinary inclinations of dental research groups to the nanotechnological field, altogether with the major investments aimed toward developing the methods to grow tooth structures artificially by soft chemical approaches and to understand the mechanism for remineralization of dental defects at various scales in vivo, certainly present a promising trend. Nevertheless the pace of application of nanotechnology to dentistry has been less than revolutionary. Scientists believe that nanotechnology could give man a better quality of life, power to prevent diseases, speed up tissue reconstruction, and alter his genetic sequence in the future. “There is plenty of room at the bottom.”",2012-12-31,"Mehta, M.; Subramani, K.",Emerging Nanotechnologies in Dentistry,,,True,custom_license

These terms have to be defined and used consistently by all the people and all the programs that access data referred to by the “terms.” The chapter examines where that chaos comes from and the role that taxonomies and ontologies play to help make definitions more precise and more commonly understood. The chapter examines business vocabularies and various ways they are organized. Vocabulary is the set of symbols (words) to which a given language has ascribed shared meaning. Taxonomy is a form of organized vocabulary. Classically the organization is hierarchic, based on some attributes of the things being classified. Ontology is a specification of a conceptualization. The chapter concludes with a discussion on how categorization relates to behavior and the power of dynamic categorization.",2003-12-31,"McComb, Dave",Semantics in Business Systems,,,True,custom_license

Use of medical devices with antimicrobial functions has been considered as a major avenue to fight against microbial infections. In addition, suitable packaging can slow the deterioration rate, and hence, extend the shelf-life of food.

Igs are divided into classes having different physico-chemical structures and biological activities. The major Ig classes in bovine and human milk are IgA, IgG and IgM. Bovine colostral Igs provide the newborn calf with passive immune protection against microbial infections until the calf’s own immune system matures. Colostral Ig preparations designed for farm animals have been commercially available for many years. Potential health benefits attributed to bovine colostrum have increased manufacture and marketing of colostral Ig-based dietary supplements also for human use. Furthermore, specific anti-microbial antibodies can be produced into colostrum by immunizing cows with vaccines made of pathogenic microorganisms. These antibodies can be concentrated and used to formulate so-called immune milk preparations. Such preparations have proven effective in prevention of animal and human infections caused, e.g. by rotavirus, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus mutans, Cryptosporidium parvum and Helicobacter pylori. Their therapeutic efficacy, however, seems limited. A few immune milk products have been commercialized and more can be expected in the future for use, e.g. as a supportive means in antibiotic treatments and for prevention of hospital infections.",2009-12-31,"Korhonen, H.J.; Marnila, P.",Dairy-Derived Ingredients,,,True,custom_license

A series of higher hygiene zones have been created to protect the product from microbiological cross-contamination events after it has been heat treated or decontaminated.

Another approach is to design the material itself to possess the antibacterial properties, especially at the surface of the material. The applications have been found in orthopaedics and cardiovascular grafts, as a means of reducing the incidence of infection. In the wound care industry, using antibacterial bioactive materials to control infection is always the first line for wound treatment. However, there are still considerable limitations, including the difficulty in treatment of the infection at depth, the control of the biofilm formation, and the development of generic and specific antibacterial bioactive materials.

The selection of reusable and disposable textiles is determined by many factors, such as cost, protective and comfort properties of the textiles, government regulations, and possibly social and psychological perceptions of both types of textile. This chapter intends to provide a broad view on both disposable and reusable textiles, as well as suggestions on improved protection against transmission of infectious diseases by textile materials.",2011-12-31,"Sun, G.",Textiles for Hygiene and Infection Control,,,True,custom_license

Biocidal properties should be a necessary feature for medical-use textiles. Biocidal functions, different from biostatic functions, include sterilization, disinfection, and sanitization in an order of the strength. According to guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), medical use biocidal functions should be at least at the disinfection level, which can inactivate most infectious microorganisms. In addition, biocidal functions on textile materials should survive repeated laundering if used as uniforms, linens and even reusable surgical scraps and gowns. Among the currently investigated antimicrobial materials, only N-halamines have shown the capability of providing fast and total kill against a wide range of microorganisms without causing resistance from microorganisms. Furthermore, halamine structures can be recharged by chlorine bleaching, a process recommended by CD as well. Thus, biocidal textiles containing the halamine structures have been developed. Recent studies in biocidal polymers have resulted interesting progresses in incorporating halamines to all synthetic fabrics that are widely used as medical and other professional clothing materials.

Viral infections have been transmitted via tissue allografts such as bone, skin, cornea, and heart valves. Bone allografts have transmitted hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), and human T-cell leukaemia virus. Corneas have transmitted rabies, hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus. Heart valves have been implicated in transmitting hepatitis B. HIV-1 and CMV have been transmitted by skin allografts. Use of comprehensive donor eligibility criteria; excluding potential donors with behaviours risky for HIV-1 and hepatitis infection, and donor blood testing have greatly reduced the risk. Recent reports of HIV transmitted from a seronegative donors prompts the addition of viral nucleic acid testing of the donor. During tissue processing, many allografts are exposed to disinfectants and sterilisation steps such as gamma irradiation, which further reduce or remove the risk of transmitted disease. Some viruses are fairly resistant to gamma irradiation and the high doses needed may be harmful to the tissue allografts. Because the effectiveness of some tissue grafts depends on cellular viability, not all can be subjected to sterilisation steps, and, therefore, the risk of infectious disease transmission remains. For these, preventing the transmission of viral infection relies mostly on careful donor selection and viral testing, but processing with mild disinfectant can be useful. To further assure safety in the use of allografts, the physician and hospital should select tissue banks that follow national professional standards as their source for allografts.",2005-12-31,"Eastlund, Ted",Sterilisation of Tissues Using Ionising Radiations,,,True,custom_license

However, there is no ideal fabric that will provide protection against all hazards. Careful selection of appropriate textiles is crucial for the performance, use, care, and maintenance of protective clothing. Broadly, a clear understanding of the work environment and performance requirements, as well as knowledge of the textiles is essential for the decision making process. According to the OSHA Technical Manual, the greater the level of chemical protective clothing, the greater are the associated risks. For any given situation, equipment and clothing should be selected that provide an adequate level of protection. Overprotection as well as under-protection can be hazardous and should be avoided. In addition to protection, the selection of textiles takes into consideration factors such as the impact of protective clothing on job performance; comfort; durability; availability, and cost; use, care, and maintenance, and cultural factors. To select protective clothing materials, relevant factors have to be identified and prioritized in a multi-step process. This chapter presents a model of the decision-making process and provides some examples of the level of detail necessary in each step. It also describes an online system as a case study to illustrate how technology can be used to assist in the selection of textile materials for protective clothing.",2005-12-31,"SHAW, A",Textiles for Protection,,,True,custom_license

The markets in the developed world are now relatively mature and will show little growth for new products in the future. Growth in the developed world is concentrated on the replacement market, which represents over one-third of the total valve market. New sales growth is now concentrated in developing regions such as China, India, and South America. The majority of investment in oil exploration and development will take place in the developing countries in the Middle East, Africa, Central and South America, and South and East Asia. Chemical processing would continue to move its manufacturing to these areas with large populations and growing living standards. These improved living standards would also lead to investment in infrastructure such as extension of piped water supplies and wastewater treatment services and power generation. The major driving force in Europe is the increasing impact of the EU directives upon national legislation in subjects as diverse as water treatment and pressure system design. The major valve application in the Middle East is in the oil and petrochemical industries with the region producing nearly 30% of the world's oil, with an increasing requirement for water treatment such as desalination plants. Most of the valve sales to the region are made through large plant contractors and oil companies.",2005-12-31,"Weaver, Graham",Profile of the International Valve Industry,,,False,custom_license

When the colonies first formed the United States, there was no national public health law. In a time when traveling any significant distance was rare, infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics were often localized, to an extent that is difficult to imagine today. The origin of independent federal public health authority derives from laws designed to provide medical care for eighteenth-century merchant seamen, a group who traveled constantly and often had little access to care when they became ill in unfamiliar cities. Moreover, their illnesses threatened the mercantile trade that was essential to the economy of the fledging nation. The origins of what is now the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) began in 1798, when Congress established a fund to provide treatment for sick and injured merchant seamen. The PHS is now a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).

Exceptions can be found in the areas of fire safety and bomb threat programs, in which various regulatory and accrediting agencies have considerable involvement.

A variety of factors have been found to contribute to poor indoor-air quality in buildings, the primary one being indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air and the other major sources include outdoor pollutants . The chapter illustrates the factor affecting the indoor environmental quality which are inorganic contaminants, contaminants generated by combustion, organic contaminants, biological contaminants, and reducing exposure. People from different cultures have different comfort zones; even people belonging to the same family may feel comfortable under different conditions, and keeping everyone comfortable at the same time is an elusive goal at best. Thermal comfort involves temperature, humidity, and air movement. A comfort zone includes an optimal range and combinations of thermal factors, in which at least 80% of the building occupants feel satisfied. Ventilation is vital for the health and comfort of building occupants. It is needed to reduce and remove pollutants emitted from various internal and external sources. Good design combined with optimum air tightness is prerequisite to ensure healthy air quality, occupant comfort, and energy efficiency. There has been a lack of systematic experiments in which building materials are ranked according to their pollution strength and the impact on the indoor-air quality of using these materials in real rooms analyzed. These studies allow to quantify the extent to which using low-polluting building materials would reduce the energy needed for ventilation of buildings without compromising indoor-air quality.",2010-12-31,"Kubba, Sam","LEED Practices, Certification, and Accreditation Handbook",,,False,custom_license

Then, there are diseases that are lurking in the background, waiting for the right conditions before they strike again. In the war against these diseases, we have come to understand the behaviors of microbes in a heterogeneous world and the mechanisms governing disease transmission. These works have profoundly shaped modern knowledge of emerging and re-emerging infections.

Tous les agents pathogènes (bactéries, champignons et virus) peuvent être en cause. Les IN sont fréquentes en néonatologie, en particulier chez les prématurés qui cumulent plusieurs facteurs de risque : immaturité du système immunitaire, absence ou faible concentration d’anticorps, organisme initialement axénique soumis en quelque jours à une contamination massive en provenance de l’environnement et du personnel, durée prolongée des cathéters veineux centraux (CVC) et de la ventilation artificielle. Les principales localisations sont les bactériémies/septicémies associées ou non à un CVC et les pneumopathies associées à la ventilation artificielle, invasive ou non. Les infections urinaires, les méningites et les infections focales sont beaucoup plus rares. Le diagnostic repose sur des modifications de l’état clinique associées à un syndrome inflammatoire ; il est confirmé par les hémocultures. Si l’épidémiologie bactérienne des infections associées à un CVC est dominée par les staphylocoques coagulase négative (SCoN), les entérobactéries sont majoritaires dans les autres causes de bactériémie. La fréquence des entérobactéries résistantes aux céphalosporines est variable selon les pays mais est plus élevée dans les pays en voie de développement (PEVD). L’incidence des IN à Candida est très variable selon les pays et les services ; elle est faible en France. Celle des virus est élevée en période d’épidémie, surtout dans les unités acceptant les nouveau-nés provenant des urgences. La rapidité d’évolution des infections bactériennes et le risque de localisations secondaires impliquent d’instaurer rapidement une antibiothérapie de première intention à large spectre qui doit être réévaluée et adaptée secondairement. La mortalité globale est de 10 à 16 % ; les infections associées à un syndrome inflammatoire majorent le risque de séquelles neurologiques chez le prématuré. Abstract The mechanisms for acquiring nosocomial infections are identical in newborn to those described in the adult population. Nosocomial infections are particularly common in premature infants who combine many risk factors : immature immune system, low level of antibodies against several pathogens, parenteral nutrition through central catheter, exposure to close and frequent contacts with multiple stakeholders. Clinical signs of infections are non-specific. Diagnosis lies on increase blood inflammatory parameters and, mainly, blood cultures. Coagulase negative Staphylococci are the predominant pathogen. The rapid evolution of some of these infections and the risk of secondary locations lead to the prescription of a broad-spectrum first-line antibiotic treatment that should be re-evaluated and adjusted secondarily. Inflammatory response induced by nosocomial infections increases the risk of neurological sequellae in premature newborn.",2015-12-31,"Doit, Catherine; Biran, Valérie; Aujard, Yannick",Infections néonatales,,,True,custom_license

Durch eine möglichst große und dünne Kontaktfläche wird ein rascher Übertritt von Sauerstoff und Kohlendioxid gewährleistet. Die Atmung weist physiologisch eine sehr große Regulationsbreite auf. Ihre Kontrolle unterliegt unbewussten und bewussten Funktionen. Da beim Menschen nur eine sehr eingeschränkte Reservoirfunktion für die Atemgase im Körper existiert, sind bewusste Ventilationspausen nur kurzzeitig möglich. Atempausen führen zu Sauerstoffmangel und Azidose infolge von Kohlensäureakkumulation. Eine vitale Gefährdung durch Ventilationspausen ist jedoch ausgeschlossen, da zuvor ein nicht unterdrückbarer „imperativer“ Atemantrieb auftritt. Die Ventilation kann z. B. beim Sport auf ein Vielfaches gesteigert werden oder bei Erkrankungen der Atmungsorgane so weit reduziert sein, dass bereits unter Ruhebedingungen die Aufrechterhaltung der Blutgaswerte innerhalb der physiologischen Regulationsbreite nicht mehr gewährleistet ist (respiratorische Globalinsuffizienz, Erschöpfung der Atempumpe). Störungen des Gasaustausches Der Gasaustausch kann auf folgenden 3 Funktionsebenen gestört sein: • Atempumpe (Atemmuskulatur, knöcherner Thorax, obere Atemwege und Bronchialsystem) • Gasaustauschstrecke zwischen Lungengefäßen und Alveolarraum • Atemregulation als zentralnervöse Komponente. Pulmonale Erkrankungen können eine dieser Funktionsebenen oder, als Kombination, auch 2 oder 3 Ebenen betreffen. Sie führen in jedem Fall zu einer Limitierung der körperlichen Leistungsfähigkeit.",2009-12-31,,Innere Medizin,,,True,custom_license

However, three main groups of factors can be cited: the evolution of pathogens (RNA viruses in particular), environmental changes favoring the development of vectors and reservoirs, and human behavior. The constant movement of humans, animals and their products on the planet, densification of populations and massive displacements linked to conflicts are probably at the heart of these evolutions.

For the first time, an Ebola epidemic of exceptional magnitude dramatically engulfed several countries in West Africa since December 2013. Major failures of implementing measures to prevent human-to-human transmissions are the main cause of this large-scale Ebola outbreak. After about one-week incubation period, the Ebola virus disease is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever leading to multiple hemorrhages and to widespread organ failure. Several bat species constitute the main reservoirs of Ebola viruses. Human contamination would occur either directly from bats, widely consumed by the local populations, or through animal species susceptible to Ebola infection, such as chimpanzees and gorillas. Alongside this “natural cycle”, an “epidemic cycle” involving domestic animals living in villages such as dogs or pigs, is seriously suggested. Thus, according to the diversity of concerned animals and their clinical infection form, modalities of human contamination can be multiple and are still largely unknown. In this context, all efforts that could be made to unravel the mystery of the Ebola virus emergence in humans and clarify modalities of the virus transmission, would allow for predicting or for anticipating the future occurrence of epidemics.

This is well exemplified by several recent epidemics such as those of Nipah, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian flu, Ebola, Monkeypox, and Hantaviruses. After the initial interspecies transmission per se, the viruses can disseminate into the human population through various and distinct mechanisms. Some of them are well characterized and understood, thus allowing a certain level of risk control and prevention. Surprisingly and in contrast, the initial steps that lead to the emergence of several viruses, and of their associated diseases, remain still poorly understood. Epidemiological field studies conducted in certain specific high-risk populations are thus necessary to obtain new insights into the early events of this emergence process. Human infections by simian viruses represent increasing public health concerns. Indeed, by virtue of their genetic and physiological similarities, non-human primates (NHPs) are considered to be likely the sources of viruses that can infect humans and thus may pose a significant threat to human population. This is well illustrated by retroviruses, which have the ability to cross species, adapt to a new host and sometimes spread within these new species. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies have thus clearly showed that the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 in humans have resulted from several independent interspecies transmissions of different SIV types from Chimpanzees and African monkeys (including sooty mangabeys), respectively, probably during the first part of the last century. The situation for Human T cell Lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is, for certain aspects, quite comparable. Indeed, the origin of most HTLV-1 subtypes appears to be linked to interspecies transmission between STLV-1-infected monkeys and humans, followed by variable periods of evolution in the human host. In this review, after an introduction on emerging viruses, we will briefly present the results of a large epidemiological study performed in groups of Bantus and Pygmies living in villages and settlements located in the rain forest of the South region of Cameroon. These populations are living nearby the habitats of several monkeys and apes, often naturally infected by different retroviruses including SIV, STLV and simian foamy virus. Most of the persons included in this study were hunters of such NHPs, thus at high risk of contact with infected body fluids (blood, saliva,...) during hunting activities. After reviewing the current available data on the discovery, cross-species transmission from monkeys and apes to humans of the simian foamy retroviruses, we will report the results of our study. Such infection is a unique natural model to study the different mechanisms of restriction of retroviral emergence in Humans.",2013-12-31,"Gessain, Antoine",Bulletin de l'Académie Nationale de Médecine,,,True,custom_license

The advent of electron microscopy and molecular biology showed that diarrhea could also be caused by viruses, both in humans and in other animals. In 1969, electron microcopy was used to show, for the first time, the responsibility of a virus in a case of calf diarrhea. This “ reo-like virus ” was subsequently identified as a rotavirus, and was shown only four years later to be responsible for severe diarrhea in young children. Noroviruses, and particularly the human virus Norwalk, were subsequently discovered, followed by coronavirus, sapovirus, pestivirus, astrovirus, enteric adenoviruses, torovirus, and picobirnavirus. Some of viruses found in animals, and particularly rotaviruses, can also infect humans. Rotaviruses have been identified in numerous animal species and are generally host-specific, but zoonotic transmission has been suggested by cross-infection (especially in experimental models), by genetic studies showing a close relationship between certain human and animal rotaviruses, and by the discovery of new animal genotypes during epidemiological surveillance of human rotaviroses.

However, past studies have not yet incorporated the effects of air travel on the transmission of influenza in the construction of mathematical epidemic models. Therefore, this paper focused on the human-to-human transmission of influenza, and investigated the effects of air travel activities on an influenza pandemic in a small-world network. These activities of air travel include passengers’ consolidation, conveyance and distribution in airports and flights. Dynamic transmission models were developed to assess the expected burdens of the pandemic, with and without control measures. This study also investigated how the small-world properties of an air transportation network facilitate the spread of influenza around the globe. The results show that, as soon as the influenza is spread to the top 50 global airports, the transmission is greatly accelerated. Under the constraint of limited resources, a strategy that first applies control measures to the top 50 airports after day 13 and then soon afterwards to all other airports may result in remarkable containment effectiveness.

La etiología más frecuente es viral. Dentro de la etiología bacteriana, el principal agente responsable es Streptococcus pyogenes o estreptococo β-hemolítico del grupo A (EBHGA), causante del 5-30% de los casos. En el manejo diagnóstico, las escalas de valoración clínica para predecir la posible etiología bacteriana, son una buena ayuda para seleccionar a qué pacientes se deben practicar las técnicas de detección rápida de antígeno estreptocócico. Es conocido que, en general, sin estas técnicas se tiende al sobrediagnóstico de FAA estreptocócica, con la consiguiente prescripción innecesaria de antibióticos, muchas veces de amplio espectro. Así, con el manejo de las escalas y la técnica de diagnóstico rápido, elaboramos los algoritmos de manejo de la FAA. Los objetivos del tratamiento son acelerar la resolución de los síntomas, reducir el tiempo de contagio y prevenir las complicaciones supurativas locales y no supurativas. Los antibióticos de elección para el tratamiento de la FAA estreptocócica son penicilina y amoxicilina. La asociación de amoxicilina y clavulánico no está indicada en el tratamiento inicial en la infección aguda. Los macrólidos tampoco son un tratamiento de primera elección; su uso debe reservarse para pacientes con alergia a la penicilina. Es importante en nuestro país adecuar tanto el diagnóstico de la FAA bacteriana y la prescripción de antibióticos a la evidencia científica disponible. La implantación de protocolos de actuación en las farmacias comunitarias puede ser de utilidad para identificar y cribar los casos que no requieran tratamiento antibiótico. Abstract Acute pharyngitis in adults is one of the most common infectious diseases seen in general practitioners’ consultations. Viral aetiology is the most common. Among bacterial causes, the main agent is Streptococcus pyogenes or group A β-haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes 5%-30% of the episodes. In the diagnostic process, clinical assessment scales can help clinicians to better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test. If these techniques are not performed, an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs, resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, most of which are broad spectrum. Consequently, management algorithms that include the use of predictive clinical rules and rapid tests have been set up. The aim of the treatment is speeding up symptom resolution, reducing the contagious time span and preventing local suppurative and non-suppurative complications. Penicillin and amoxicillin are the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of pharyngitis. The association of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not indicated as the initial treatment of acute infection. Neither are macrolides indicated as first-line therapy; they should be reserved for patients allergic to penicillin. The appropriate diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis and proper use of antibiotics based on the scientific evidence available are crucial. Using management algorithms can be helpful in identifying and screening the cases that do not require antibiotic therapy.",2015-06-30,"Cots, Josep M.; Alós, Juan-Ignacio; Bárcena, Mario; Boleda, Xavier; Cañada, José L.; Gómez, Niceto; Mendoza, Ana; Vilaseca, Isabel; Llor, Carles",Acta Otorrinolaringológica Española,,,True,custom_license

Malaria has been successfully eradicated since 1961 in Japan and now only imported malaria cases are encountered. However, as the number of Japanese people who are going abroad and also the number of foreigners who are visiting Japan increases (about 16 and 5 millions, respectively, in 2001), so does the chance for Japanese doctors to see imported malaria or transfusion-transmitted malaria cases. In fact, the total number of the patients with acute malaria in Japan has been around 100–150 annually for the last 10 years. Of those, about 75% are Japanese and 25% are foreigners, and about 75% are male and 25% are female. The peak age is in the 20s. Recently, about 45% of patients are Plasmodium falciparum and another 45% Plasmodium vivax infections. The former species is likely to be seen in travelers coming back from African countries and the latter is mainly from Asian countries. The important issue is that patients in Japan have not been diagnosed promptly nor treated properly because doctors in Japan are no longer familiar with tropical medicine. Therefore, some patients are dying from severe malaria as a consequence. As it is, most of the effective medicines for drug-resistant malaria or severe malaria have not been registered in Japan.

Although for ‘old diseases’ knowledge about the right African traditional medicines to treat or cure the diseases has been passed from generation to generation, knowledge about traditional medicines to treat newly emerging diseases has to be generated in one way or another. In addition, the existing traditional medicines have to be continuously improved, which is also the case with Western scientific medicines. Whereas one school of thought supports the idea of improving medicines, be they traditional or Western, through scientific research, an opposing school of thought argues that subjecting African traditional medicines to scientific research would be tantamount to some form of colonization and imperialism. This paper argues that continuing to use African traditional medicines for old and new diseases without making concerted efforts to improve their efficacy and safety is unethical since the disease burden affecting Africa may continue to rise in spite of the availability and accessibility of the traditional medicines. Most importantly, the paper commends efforts being made in some African countries to improve African traditional medicine through a combination of different mechanisms that include the controversial approach of scientific research on traditional medicines.",2009-11-30,"Nyika, Aceme",Acta Tropica,,,True,custom_license

We develop an agent-based model (ABM), in which each individual is explicitly represented and vector populations are linked to precipitation estimates in a tropical setting. The model is implemented on both scale-free and regular networks. The spatio-temporal transmission of chikungunya is analysed and the presence of asymptomatic silent spreaders within the population is investigated in the context of implementing travel restrictions during an outbreak. Preventing the movement of symptomatic individuals is found to be an insufficient mechanism to halt the spread of the disease, which can be readily carried to neighbouring nodes via sub-clinical individuals. Furthermore, the impact of topology structure vs. precipitation levels is assessed and precipitation is found to be the dominant factor driving spatio-temporal transmission.",2014-01-31,"Dommar, Carlos J.; Lowe, Rachel; Robinson, Marguerite; Rodó, Xavier",Acta Tropica,,,True,custom_license

The efficacy of LAMP using the new primer set was assessed in this study in comparison to that of a previously described set of LAMP primers as well as with microscopy and real-time PCR as reference methods for detecting P. falciparum. Pre-addition of hydroxy napthol blue (HNB) in the LAMP reaction caused a distinct color change, thereby improving the visual detection system.

The presence and poor knowledge of zoonotic pathogens in India's wildlife and the occurrence of enormous human populations interfacing with, and critically linked to, forest ecosystems warrant attention. Factors such as diverse migratory bird populations, climate change, expanding human population and shrinking wildlife habitats play a significant role in the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens from India's wildlife. The introduction of a novel Kyasanur forest disease virus (family flaviviridae) into human populations in 1957 and subsequent occurrence of seasonal outbreaks illustrate the key role that India's wild animals play in the emergence and reemergence of zoonotic pathogens. Other high priority zoonotic diseases of wildlife origin which could affect both livestock and humans include influenza, Nipah, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, plague, leptospirosis, anthrax and leishmaniasis. Continuous monitoring of India's extensively diverse and dispersed wildlife is challenging, but their use as indicators should facilitate efficient and rapid disease-outbreak response across the region and occasionally the globe. Defining and prioritizing research on zoonotic pathogens in wildlife are essential, particularly in a multidisciplinary one-world one-health approach which includes human and veterinary medical studies at the wildlife-livestock-human interfaces.

It was first described in the 1950s during a Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak in southern Tanzania and has since (re-) emerged and spread to several other geographical areas, reaching large populations and causing massive epidemics. In recent years, CHIKV has gained considerable attention due to its quick spread to the Caribbean and then in the Americas, with many cases reported between 2014 and 2017. CHIKV has further garnered attention due to the clinical diagnostic difficulties when Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) viruses are simultaneously present. In this review, topical CHIKV-related issues, such as epidemiology and transmission, are examined. The different manifestations of infection (acute, chronic and atypical) are described and a particular focus is placed upon the diagnostic handling in the case of ZIKV and DENV co-circulating. Natural and synthetic compounds under evaluation for treatment of chikungunya disease, including drugs already licensed for other purposes, are also discussed. Finally, previous and current vaccine strategies, as well as the control of the CHIKV transmission through an integrated vector management, are reviewed in some detail.",2018-12-31,"Silva, José V.J.; Ludwig-Begall, Louisa F.; Oliveira-Filho, Edmilson F. de; Oliveira, Renato A.S.; Durães-Carvalho, Ricardo; Lopes, Thaísa R.R.; Silva, Daisy E.A.; Gil, Laura H.V.G.",Acta Tropica,,,True,custom_license

We investigated the prevalence and genetic diversity of HBV in bats in China. In this study, a total of 197 insectivorous bats belonging to 10 bat species were captured from karst caves in Mengyin County, Shandong Province and Xianning City, Hubei Province, China. PCR amplification indicated that in total 6.6% (13/197) bats were positive to HBVs. The HBV positive rate in bats was 7.1% (9/127) and 5.7% (4/70) in Shandong Province and Hubei Province, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that HBV from the two places were in the same cluster with 90.5%–99.5% homology, but distinct from bat HBVs from other places in China and other countries.

However, in disease endemic settings across many parts of the globe, most of the disease control interventions accounts for small and large ruminants, whereas unusual hosts and/or natural reservoirs, such as camels, remain neglected for disease control measures including routine vaccination. Such a policy drawback not only plays an important role in disease epizootiology particularly in settings where disease is endemic, but also serves an obstacle in disease control and subsequent eradication in future. With this background, using pre-validated ELISA and molecular assays [multiplex PCR, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and real-time (rt)-PCR], we conducted a large-scale pathogen- and antibody-based surveillance for brucellosis, peste des petits ruminants and bluetongue in camel population (n = 992) originating from a wide geographical region in southern part of the Punjab province, Pakistan. Varying in each of the selected districts, the seroprevalence was found to be maximum for bluetongue [n = 697 (70.26%, 95% CI: 67.29–73.07)], followed by PPR [n = 193 (19.46%, 95% CI: 17.07–22.09)] and brucellosis [n = 66 (6.65%, 95% CI: 5.22–8.43)]. Odds of seroprevalence were more significantly associated with pregnancy status (non-pregnant, OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.86–5.63, p<0.01), farming system (mixed-animal, OR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.56–4.29, p<0.01), breed (Desi, OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.28–4.03, p<0.01) and farmer education (illiterate, OR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.45–6.93, p<0.01) for BTV, body condition (normal, OR = 3.54, 95% CI: 1.92–6.54, p<0.01) and breed (Desi, OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.09–4.40, p<0.01) for brucellosis, and feeding system for PPR (grazing, OR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.79–4.22, p<0.01). Among the total herds included (n = 74), genome corresponding to BT virus (BTV) and brucellosis was detected in 14 (18.92%, 95 CI: 11.09–30.04) and 19 herds (25.68%, 95% CI: 16.54–37.38), respectively. None of the herds was detected with genome of PPR virus (PPRV). Among the positive herds, serotype 1, 8 and 11 were detected for BTV while all the herds were exclusively positive to B. abortus.

This study aimed to assess the confidence and its predictors in HMPX case management among general practitioners (GPs), the frontline doctors in Indonesia, and to explore their perspectives on HMPX. Between May and July 2019, GPs in Indonesia completed an online-based survey. The questionnaire collected information on GPs’ confidence, perspective, sociodemographic, workplace and professional characteristics, exposure to HMPX information and knowledge on HMPX. A logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the explanatory variables influencing the confidence and the perspective. We included 395 GPs in our analysis (77.4% out of 510 responses received) of which 10.1% and 34.9% were classified having good confidence using an 80% and 70% cut-off for confidence score, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, receiving information about HMPX during medical training was the only variable significantly associated with good confidence (adjusted odds ratio 2.74, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 4.78 and p<0.001). Approximately 73.6% and 77.9% of GPs agreed that HMPX is an important infectious disease and it has potential to detrimentally impact the Indonesian economy, respectively. In addition, 88.8% of GPs suggested that the disease should be incorporated into the National Medical Curriculum of Indonesia. In conclusion, in case of HMPX outbreak, majority of the GPs in Indonesia seem to be less confident in diagnosing and treating cases, using their current knowledge, skills and their workplace facilities. Therefore, a systematic strategy to improve their confidence in managing HMPX is required.",2020-03-16,"Harapan, Harapan; Setiawan, Abdul M.; Yufika, Amanda; Anwar, Samsul; Wahyuni, Sri; Asrizal, Febrivan W.; Sufri, Muhammad R.; Putra, Reza P.; Wijayanti, Nanda P.; Salwiyadi, Salwiyadi; Maulana, Razi; Khusna, Afriyani; Nusrina, Ina; Shidiq, Muhammad; Fitriani, Devi; Muharrir, Muharrir; Husna, Cut A.; Yusri, Fitria; Maulana, Reza; Utomo, Prattama S.; Andalas, Mohd; Wagner, Abram L.; Mudatsir, Mudatsir",Acta Tropica,,,True,custom_license

Recently, DNA-based materials have attracted substantial consideration for the exploration of smart hydrogels, in which their properties can change in response to chemical or physical stimuli. In other words, these gels can undergo switchable gel-to-sol or sol-to-gel transitions upon application of different triggers. Moreover, various functional motifs like i-motif structures, antisense DNAs, DNAzymes, and aptamers can be inserted into the polymer network to offer a molecular recognition capability to the complex.

A sample of 279 Chinese female nurses completed questionnaires in a two-wave longitudinal survey. With a cross–lagged analysis, the results indicated that family mastery at Time 1 had a significant positive effect on work engagement at Time 2. Furthermore, the relationship between family mastery and work engagement was stronger in a context of high (vs. low) job demand. These findings suggested that resource generated in family could directly help people stay engaged in the workplace, particularly under stressful working conditions. Our findings have expanded the JD-R model of work engagement and bridged it with theory of work–family enrichment.

Methods The authors designed a benchtop experiment to evaluate spatter patterns after performing simulated occlusal surface preparations on three typodont teeth in a dental manikin. Fluorescein dye served as the marker to enable visualization of the spatter distribution. The authors compared the effectiveness of a nonisolated control consisting of high-volume evacuation (HVE) alone with that of two dry-field isolation techniques: a dental dam with HVE and the Isolite system (Isolite Systems, Santa Barbara, Calif). Results The authors performed a two-way analysis of variance. Both the Isolite device and the dental dam with HVE exhibited a significant decrease in the number of contaminated squares (P < .001) compared with that for the nonisolated control. In addition, overall, the results showed no statistically significant difference between the Isolite system and the dental dam with HVE (P = .126). Conclusions The study results showed that use of a dental dam with HVE or the Isolite system significantly reduced spatter overall compared with use of HVE alone. Clinical Implications Isolation with a dental dam and HVE or with the Isolite system appears to aid in the reduction of spatter during operative dental procedures, potentially reducing exposure to oral pathogens.",2012-11-30,"Dahlke, William O.; Cottam, Michael R.; Herring, Matthew C.; Leavitt, Joshua M.; Ditmyer, Marcia M.; Walker, Richard S.",The Journal of the American Dental Association,,,True,custom_license

Types of Studies Reviewed The authors reviewed representative medical and dental literature for studies and reports that documented the spread of disease through an airborne route. They also reviewed the dental literature for representative studies of contamination from various dental procedures and methods of reducing airborne contamination from those procedures. Results The airborne spread of measles, tuberculosis and SARS is well-documented in the medical literature. The dental literature shows that many dental procedures produce aerosols and droplets that are contaminated with bacteria and blood. These aerosols represent a potential route for disease transmission. The literature also documents that airborne contamination can be minimized easily and inexpensively by layering several infection control steps into the routine precautions used during all dental procedures.

Methods The author reviewed Standard Precautions, including two new elements introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2007: safe injection practices and respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette. Standard Precautions sometimes are referred to as the first tier of precautions because for some diseases and circumstances, transmission cannot be interrupted completely with Standard Precautions alone and it is necessary to use second-tier Transmission-Based Precautions. The author reviewed the three categories of Transmission-Based Precautions—Airborne, Droplet and Contact—with an emphasis on their use in dental health care outpatient settings. Conclusions and Clinical Implications Dental health care personnel (DHCP) should update their infection control programs to ensure that safe injection practices and respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette measures are used routinely.

Although it has been well-contained, sporadic cases continue to emerge. Objectives The authors trace the emergence of the SARS outbreak from southern China and its spread worldwide, discuss the viral etiology of the infection and its clinical features, and review the infection control guidelines issued during the outbreak by the health authorities in Hong Kong, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and the American Dental Association. They also review the prospects for a new outbreak and preventive measures. Overview The disease, which is caused by a novel coronavirus termed the “SARS coronavirus,” or SARS-CoV, essentially spreads through droplet infection and affects people of any age. It has a mortality rate ranging from 10 to 15 percent. A major hallmark of this disease has been the rate at which it has affected health care workers through nosocomial transmission; in some countries, up to one-fourth to one-third of those infected were in this category. However, no dental health care worker has been affected by SARS in a nosocomial or dental setting. Conclusions and Clinical Implications Researchers believe that a combination of factors, including the universal infection control measures that the dental community has implemented and/or the low degree of viral shedding in the prodromal phase of SARS, may have obviated the spread of the disease in dental settings. The dental community should reflect on this outbreak to reinforce the currently applied infection control measures.",2004-09-30,"SAMARANAYAKE, LAKSHMAN P.; PEIRIS, MALIK",The Journal of the American Dental Association,,,True,custom_license

We assessed the relative filtering efficacy of two currently used surgical face masks (one a molded mask, the other a tie-on mask) and a certified personal particulate respirator, all made by a single manufacturer. Methods The authors sprayed bicarbonate particulate against a porcelain surface (representing the patient's mouth) and collected it via a mannequin head (representing the dentist's head) placed 40 centimeters away and a tube with two airflow rates (0.5 cubic meters per hour and 9 m3/hour). They calculated the dry residue weight. They performed three separate runs for each mask and three runs with no mask at the two airflow rates with and without aerosol. Results With no mask (control), the authors recorded significant weight gains at both airflow rates with and without vaporization. With vaporization, the three masks were associated with different dry residue weights (P < .03 with the Kruskal-Wallis test at both flow rates), the respirator providing the lowest amount. The respirator provided an efficiency of 94 to 96 percent, compared with 90 to 92 percent and 85 to 86 percent for the molded and tie-on surgical masks, respectively.

About half are due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and 80% occur in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, low-cost therapies would be invaluable. Although glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) infusion and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) appear to be promising in AMI, the available trials are inconclusive and these treatments require rigorous evaluation. Methods The Clinical Trial of Reviparin and Metabolic Modulation in Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment and Evaluation-Estudios Clínicos Latino America (CREATE-ECLA) study is a randomized controlled trial in ST-elevation AMI patients evaluating a 24-hour infusion of Glucose-Insulin-Potassium (GIK) intravenous vs usual care (control) on 30-day mortality in 20 000 patients from 21 countries. Patients from India and China (n = 15 000) are also randomized using a factorial design to receive low-molecular-weight heparin (Reviparin) or placebo injection twice daily for 7 days to assess the impact on the composite outcomes of death, reinfarction or stroke (first co-primary outcome) or the composite + refractory ischemia (second co-primary outcome). Results Twenty thousand two hundred and one (20,201) GIK/control patients and 15,570 Reviparin/placebo patients have been included, with results expected in November 2004. Conclusions The CREATE-ECLA trial will provide definitive answers to the role of 2 practical, promising and low-cost therapies, LMWH and GIK, in AMI patients.

Two closely related innate immunity genes, CD209 and CD209L, are particularly interesting because they directly recognize a plethora of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Both genes, which result from an ancient duplication, possess a neck region, made up of seven repeats of 23 amino acids each, known to play a major role in the pathogen-binding properties of these proteins. To explore the extent to which pathogens have exerted selective pressures on these innate immunity genes, we resequenced them in a group of samples from sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and East Asia. Moreover, variation in the number of repeats of the neck region was defined in the entire Human Genome Diversity Panel for both genes. Our results, which are based on diversity levels, neutrality tests, population genetic distances, and neck-region length variation, provide genetic evidence that CD209 has been under a strong selective constraint that prevents accumulation of any amino acid changes, whereas CD209L variability has most likely been shaped by the action of balancing selection in non-African populations. In addition, our data point to the neck region as the functional target of such selective pressures: CD209 presents a constant size in the neck region populationwide, whereas CD209L presents an excess of length variation, particularly in non-African populations. An additional interesting observation came from the coalescent-based CD209 gene tree, whose binary topology and time depth (∼2.8 million years ago) are compatible with an ancestral population structure in Africa. Altogether, our study has revealed that even a short segment of the human genome can uncover an extraordinarily complex evolutionary history, including different pathogen pressures on host genes as well as traces of admixture among archaic hominid populations.",2005-11-30,"Barreiro, Luis B.; Patin, Etienne; Neyrolles, Olivier; Cann, Howard M.; Gicquel, Brigitte; Quintana-Murci, Lluís",The American Journal of Human Genetics,,,True,custom_license

Methods Of 343 patients who met the World Health Organization’s case definition of probable SARS and who had been admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong, 201 patients had laboratory evidence of SARS coronavirus infection. The initial frontal chest radiographs of these 201 patients were assessed in a blinded fashion by 3 radiologists; individual findings were accepted if at least 2 of the radiologists concurred. Independent predictors of an adverse outcome, defined as the need for assisted ventilation, death, or both, were identified by multivariate analysis. Results Bilateral disease and involvement of more than two zones on the initial chest radiograph were associated with a higher risk of liver impairment and poor clinical outcome. Forty-two patients (21%) developed an adverse outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that lung involvement of more than two zones (odds ratio [OR] = 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7 to 17.9), older age (OR for each decade of life = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.0), and shortness of breath on admission (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.1 to 7.4) were independent predictors of an adverse outcome.

Respiratory secretions were tested for nucleic acids of a panel of respiratory viruses. An increase in antibody titer was assessed for 4 coronavirus strains. Results Virus-associated illnesses (29 [39.1%] of 74 illnesses in group 1 and 59 [48.7%] of 121 illnesses in group 2) occurred in all calendar quarters, most commonly in the first and fourth quarters.

Although plans for using 30-day readmission measures are under consideration for younger patients, little is known about readmission in younger patients or the relationship between readmissions in younger and elderly patients at the same hospital. Methods By using the 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database, we examined readmission patterns in younger patients (18-64 years) using hierarchical models to evaluate associations between hospital 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates in elderly Medicare patients and readmission risk in younger patients with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or pneumonia. Results There were 87,818, 98,315, and 103,251 admissions in younger patients for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia, respectively, with overall 30-day unplanned readmission rates of 8.5%, 21.4%, and 13.7%, respectively. Readmission risk in younger patients was significantly associated with hospital 30-day risk-standardized readmission rates for elderly Medicare patients for all 3 conditions. A decrease in an average hospital's 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates from the 75th percentile to the 25th percentile was associated with reduction in younger patients' risk of readmission from 8.8% to 8.0% (difference: 0.7%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.9) for acute myocardial infarction; 21.8% to 20.0% (difference: 1.8%; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.2) for heart failure; and 13.9% to 13.1% (difference: 0.8%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.0) for pneumonia. Conclusions Among younger patients, readmission risk was moderately associated with hospital 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates in elderly Medicare beneficiaries.

The respiratory viruses—which include influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses—cause the majority of these illnesses. Some of these viruses cause illness throughout the year, whereas others are most common in winter. All population groups experience these infections and illnesses. As the number of elderly persons and those with underlying disease increases, awareness is growing that these common infections can have serious consequences. This has recently been emphasized for immunocompromised persons. At the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), infection surveillance of mostly hospitalized adults with leukemia or a recent bone marrow transplant yielded a respiratory virus from 181 of 668 (27.1%) respiratory illness episodes. In descending order of frequency, infections with RSV, rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses were detected in each of three surveillance years. High frequencies of nosocomial acquisition occurred, as has been noted in prior reports. Similarly, persistence of infection and high frequencies of pneumonia and death among infected patients occurred, which have also been noted earlier. At MDACC, pneumonia occurred in 58–78% of infected patients, and 22–44% died. The role of the virus infection in many cases of pneumonia is uncertain, but death from pure viral pneumonia is well documented. A number of immune deficiencies in this patient population and options for control of these infections have been described that can, respectively, account for the medical problem and provide ways to approach prevention and treatment.",1997-03-17,"Couch, MD, Robert B.; Englund, MD, Janet A.",The American Journal of Medicine,,,True,custom_license

However, relatively little is known about the impact of these common infections on individuals with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A review of the literature identifies three key areas that need further exploration. First, moderate-to-severe and even fatal lower respiratory viral illnesses in HIV-infected individuals have been reported. In general, the clinical presentation of these respiratory viral infections in persons with HIV infection is similar to their presentation in individuals without HIV infection. The major exception is the occurrence of fulminant, and often fatal, disseminated adenovirus infection in adults and children with HIV disease. Despite these reports, no information is available regarding the frequency of moderate-to-severe respiratory viral illnesses in individuals with HIV infection. Epidemiologic studies of respiratory viral illnesses in cohorts of HIV-infected adults and children are needed. Second, prolonged shedding of respiratory viruses for weeks and even months has been documented in HIV-infected adults and children. The frequency of prolonged shedding in this population has not been well defined, but data from a small newborn cohort study suggest that, at least for RSV, prolonged shedding is common. Prolonged respiratory viral shedding has implications for infection control in medical facilities where HIV-infected individuals are treated and in nursing homes, child care centers, and group foster homes that provide care for HIV-infected individuals. Therapies to help eliminate these chronic viral infections should be explored. Finally, indirect evidence suggests that respiratory viral infection may result in changes in HIV replication and, theoretically, HIV disease progression. Increased HIV-1 replication has been demonstrated in vitro in T lymphoma cells exposed to genetic material from adenovirus. Increased HIV replication in peripheral blood from adults following inactivated influenza vaccination has been reported. The impact of natural respiratory viral infection (and perhaps vaccination against these pathogens) on HIV replication and disease progression will be an important area of study.",1997-03-17,"King, James C",The American Journal of Medicine,,,True,custom_license

Diarrhea in the immunocompromised host, traveler’s diarrhea, and diarrhea in the hospitalized patient are also discussed. Most episodes of acute diarrhea are self-limited, and investigations should be performed only if the results will influence management and outcome. After an adequate history and physical examination, the clinician should be able to classify the acute diarrheal illness, assess the severity, and determine whether investigations are needed. Most patients do not require specific therapy. Therapy should mainly be directed at preventing dehydration. Various home remedies frequently suffice in mild, self-limited diarrhea. However, in large-volume, dehydrating diarrhea, oral rehydration solutions should be used, as they are formulated to stimulate sodium and water absorption. Antidiarrheal agents can be useful in reducing the number of bowel movements and diminishing the magnitude of fluid loss. The most useful agents are opiate derivatives and bismuth subsalicylate. Antibiotic therapy is not required in most patients with acute diarrheal disorders. Guidelines for their use are presented.",1999-06-30,"Aranda-Michel, Jaime; Giannella, Ralph A",The American Journal of Medicine,,,True,custom_license

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials to estimate the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of acute bronchitis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: English-language studies published January 1966 to April 1998 were retrieved using MEDLINE, bibliographies, and consultation with experts. Only randomized trials that enrolled otherwise healthy patients with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis, used an antibiotic in the treatment group and a placebo in the control group, and provided sufficient data to calculate an effect size were included. RESULTS: We identified eight randomized controlled trials that satisfied all inclusion criteria. These studies used one of three antibiotics (erythromycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). The use of antibiotics decreased the duration of cough and sputum production by approximately one-half day (summary effect size 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.36). For specific symptoms, there were nonsignificant trends favoring the use of antibiotics: a decrease of 0.4 days of purulent sputum (95% CI, −0.1 to 0.8), a decrease of 0.5 days of cough (95% CI, −0.1 to 1.1), and a decrease of 0.3 days lost from work (95% CI, −0.6 to 1.1). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests a small benefit from the use of the antibiotics erythromycin, doxycycline, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy patients. As this small benefit must be weighed against the risk of side effects and the societal cost of increasing antibiotic resistance, we believe that the use of antibiotics is not justified in these patients.",1999-07-31,"Bent, Stephen; Saint, Sanjay; Vittinghoff, Eric; Grady, Deborah",The American Journal of Medicine,,,True,custom_license

Understanding the relationship between an inciting event or agent and the development of IDC has progressed only recently. Once IDC has developed, treatment is palliative and little can be done to alter the natural course of the disease. Active myocarditis, a suspected precursor of IDC, is myocardial inflammation and injury without ischemia. The disease ranges from a self-limited flulike illness to one of serious consequence with arrhythmias, heart failure, or death. Many agents have been associated with myocarditis, and the clinical manifestations depend on an interplay between the inciting agent and the host response. The development of a murine model and the expanded use of endomyocardial biopsy using the Dallas criteria have increased our understanding of myocarditis and its sequelae. Therapy consists of managing symptoms using conventional medical regimens for heart failure. Immunosuppressive therapy should be reserved for patients with biopsy-proven disease who have failed conventional therapy.

Study Design Pregnant rats were infected intravenously at gestation day 14 with 0 (control), 101, 103, 105, and 107 colony forming units of M pulmonis and necropsied at gestational day 18. Quantitative culture of maternal and fetal tissues as well as histopathologic examination of the placenta were performed. Results We have characterized a rat model of maternal and fetal infection that can be manipulated by alteration of infectious dose. Colonization of Sprague-Dawley rat dam and fetal tissues by M pulmonis occurred in a dose-dependent manner after intravenous inoculation (P < .001). Placental lesion severity increased with infection dose (P = .0001). The minimum threshold dose required to establish infection of the dam and fetus was at least 103 colony forming units, with consistent colonization of maternal and fetal tissues achieved only with 107 colony forming units. In some instances, rat fetal tissues could be colonized in the absence of concomitant amniotic fluid colonization. Interestingly, there appeared to be a predilection for colonization of the reproductive tissues. Conclusions In the Sprague-Dawley rat, the infection rate of both the dam and fetus can be controlled by the inoculum dose. Our data support the concept that hematogenous spread of M pulmonis to the rat fetus can occur without amniotic fluid infection and suggest that the fetus itself can potentially seed the amniotic fluid with microorganisms. Importantly, manipulation of both the route of infection as well as infection dose provide a reproducible way to study both maternal and fetal immune response to infection during pregnancy.",2008-03-31,"Riggs, Margaret A.; Maunsell, Fiona P.; Reyes, Leticia; Brown, Mary B.",American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology,,,True,custom_license

The mouse disease is primarily immune-mediated because demyelination is not detected in JHM-infected mice lacking T or B cells but does occur after transfer of JHM-specific T cells. Although less is known about the ability of antibodies to mediate demyelination, the presence of oligoclonally expanded B cells and high concentrations of antibodies (against self or infectious agents) in the central nervous system of many multiple sclerosis patients suggests that antibodies may also contribute to myelin destruction. Here, we show that anti-JHM antibodies, in the absence of T or B cells, caused demyelination in JHM-infected mice. Anti-JHM antibody was detected adjacent to areas of demyelination, consistent with a direct interaction between antibody and infected cells. Demyelination was reduced by 85 to 90% in infected RAG1−/− mice lacking normal expression of activating Fc receptors (FcRγ−/−) and by ∼76% when complement was depleted by treatment with cobra venom factor.

Viral expression was seen mainly at the apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract, and less frequently in type 1 pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. Both cell tropism and respiratory lesions were distinct from those of SARS-associated coronavirus infection, excluding hMPV as the primary cause of SARS. This study demonstrates that hMPV is a respiratory pathogen and indicates that viral replication is short-lived, polarized to the apical surface, and occurs primarily in ciliated respiratory epithelial cells.",2004-06-30,"Kuiken, Thijs; van den Hoogen, Bernadette G.; van Riel, Debby A.J.; Laman, Jon D.; van Amerongen, Geert; Sprong, Leo; Fouchier, Ron A.M.; Osterhaus, Albert D.M.E.",The American Journal of Pathology,,,True,custom_license

Similarly, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is causing severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory disease in calves. Both viruses are pneumovirus and the infections with human respiratory syncytial virus and BRSV have similar clinical, pathological, and epidemiological characteristics. In this study we used experimental BRSV infection in calves as a model of respiratory syncytial virus infection to demonstrate important aspects of viral replication and clearance in a natural target animal. Replication of BRSV was demonstrated in the luminal part of the respiratory epithelial cells and replication in the upper respiratory tract preceded the replication in the lower respiratory tract. Virus excreted to the lumen of the respiratory tract was cleared by neutrophils whereas apoptosis was an important way of clearance of BRSV-infected epithelial cells. Neighboring cells, which probably were epithelial cells, phagocytized the BRSV-infected apoptotic cells. The number of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased during the course of infection, but the T cells were not found between the epithelial cells of the bronchi up until apoptosis was no longer detected, thus in the bronchi there was no indication of direct contact-dependent T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the primary infection.",2002-12-31,"Viuff, Birgitte; Tjørnehøj, Kirsten; Larsen, Lars E.; Røntved, Christine M.; Uttenthal, Åse; Rønsholt, Leif; Alexandersen, Soren",The American Journal of Pathology,,,True,custom_license

The HFGL2 gene is approximately 7 kb in length with 2 exons. The putative promoter contains cis element consensus sequences that strongly suggest the inducibility of its expression. From the nucleotide sequence of the human gene, a 439-amino acid long protein is predicted. The overall identity between the murine fgl2 and hfgl2 coded proteins is over 70%. About 225 amino acids at the carboxyl end of these molecules are almost 90% identical, and correspond to a well-conserved fibrinogen-related domain. Both HFGL2 and FGL2 encode a type II transmembrane protein with a predicted catalytic domain toward the amino terminus of the protein. Transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a full-length cDNA of HFGL2 coding region resulted in high levels of prothrombinase activity. Livers from 8 patients transplanted for fulminant viral hepatitis were examined for extent of necrosis, inflammation, fibrin deposition, and HFGL2 induction. In situ hybridization showed positive staining of macrophages in areas of active hepatocellular necrosis. Fibrin stained positively in these areas and was confirmed by electron microscopy.

However, the host immune response after severe 2009 pH1N1 infection is poorly understood. Herein, we investigated viral load, the immune response, and apoptosis in lung tissues from 50 fatal cases with 2009 pH1N1 virus infection. The results suggested that 7 of the 27 cytokines/chemokines showed remarkably high expression, including IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-β, and interferon-inducible protein-10 in lung tissues of 2009 pH1N1 fatal cases. Viral load, which showed the highest level on day 7 of illness onset and persisted until day 17 of illness, was positively correlated with mRNA levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-β, interferon-inducible protein-10, and regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted. Apoptosis was evident in lung tissues stained by the TUNEL assay. Decreased Fas and elevated FasL mRNA levels were present in lung tissues, and cleaved caspase-3 was frequently seen in pneumocytes, submucosal glands, and lymphoid tissues. The pathogenesis of the 2009 pH1N1 virus infection is associated with viral replication and production of proinflammatory mediators. FasL and caspase-3 are involved in the pathway of 2009 pH1N1 virus-induced apoptosis in lung tissues, and the disequilibrium between the Fas and FasL level in lung tissues could contribute to delayed clearance of the virus and subsequent pathological damages.",2013-10-31,"Gao, Rongbao; Bhatnagar, Julu; Blau, Dianna M.; Greer, Patricia; Rollin, Dominique C.; Denison, Amy M.; Deleon-Carnes, Marlene; Shieh, Wun-Ju; Sambhara, Suryaprakash; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Patel, Mitesh; Liu, Lindy; Paddock, Christopher; Drew, Clifton; Shu, Yuelong; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Zaki, Sherif R.",The American Journal of Pathology,,,True,custom_license

These essential immune responses are triggered by common TLR pattern recognition receptors of microbial products expressed through the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal Toll/IL-1 domain. Toll/IL-1 adapter protein cascades are induced by an activated Toll/IL-1 to induce transient transcription responses. All TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, use an MyD88 adapter to Toll/IL-1 to initiate a proinflammatory cascade. TLR3 uses the toll receptor 3/4 induction factor adapter to initiate a different cytosolic adapter cascade with double-stranded RNA agonists. This non-MyD88 pathway induces both NF-κB and type 1 interferon responses. By using a TLR3-restricted double-stranded RNA agonist, rintatolimod, we demonstrate significant unexpected differences in toxic responses between rats and primates. The mechanism of this differential response is consistent with a relative down-regulation of the NF-κB inflammatory cytokine induction pathway in the cynomolgus monkey and humans, but not observed systemically in rat.

Fundamental concepts relating to these methods, such as the basic reproductive number, the effective reproductive number and the susceptible-infected-recovered compartmental models, are reviewed. In addition, comparisons and contrasts are made between the following concepts: microparasites and macroparasites, deterministic and stochastic models, difference and differential equations and homogeneous and heterogeneous mixing patterns.

However, certain viruses have entered the human genome. Of the human genome, ∼45% is composed of transposable elements (long interspersed nuclear elements [LINEs], short interspersed nuclear elements [SINEs] and transposons) and 5-8% is derived from viral sequences with similarity to infectious retroviruses.

The drastic enhancement of fluorescence intensity of berberine was attributed to the formation of an inclusion complex between HDB-β-CD and berberine, which has been utilized as the basis of the fabrication of a berberine-sensitive fluorescence sensor. The proposed sensor was quite distinct from those fluorescent sensors for berberine reported so far which relied upon quenching the fluorescence of the sensing reagent immobilized on membrane by berberine. The response mechanism of optode membrane was discussed in detail from the view of molecular dynamics and the optimum steric configuration of the inclusion complex was presented by molecular dynamics simulation. The analytical performance characteristics of the proposed berberine-sensitive sensor were investigated. The sensor can be applied to the quantification of berberine with a linear range covering from 4.0×10−7 to 2.0×10−5 moll−1 with a detection limit of 8.0×10−8 moll−1. The sensor exhibits excellent reproducibility, reversibility and selectivity.

In this work, mass spectral profiling, a new tool for data processing is proposed to help a lot in solving this problem as gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) is used to detect both the active and non-active ingredients buried in HMs. The main idea of mass spectral profiling is employment of target m/z points of GC–MS data on the extraction of chromatographic profiles of pure and/or mixed compositions concerned. Further, the absolute or relative abundance at these m/z points can be utilized for results interpretation. With the help of this tool, the qualitative and quantitative information of chemical components within complicated HMs will be mined out effectively. It can then be recommended as reference indices to assess the importance of target compositions in HMs, such as efficacy evaluation on disease treatment of the active constituents. Mass spectral profiling with less data points significantly improves the possibility to get the rich information with no strong requirements of data preprocessing procedures, like alignment of shift of retention times among different chromatographic profiles. It is powerful for quality control of HMs coupled with pattern recognition techniques on high-throughput data sets. In this study, a commonly used herbal medicine, Houttuynia cordata Thunb and its finished injection products, were used to deliver the strategies. Absolutely, the working principles can be extended to the investigation of metabonomics with gas chromatography–time-of-flight–mass spectrometry (GC–MS–TOF). The good performance of mass spectral profiling shows that it can be a promising tool in the future studies of complex mixture systems.",2007-12-05,"Zeng, Zhong-Da; Liang, Yi-Zeng; Chau, Foo-Tim; Chen, Shuo; Daniel, Mok Kam-Wah; Chan, Chi-On",Analytica Chimica Acta,,,True,custom_license

Among them is dengue virus, the etiologic agent of the mosquito-borne dengue disease, one of the most important emerging infectious pathologies of nowadays. Dengue fever may cause potentially deadly hemorrhagic symptoms and is endemic in the tropical and sub-tropical world, being also a serious threat to temperate countries in the developed world. Effective diagnostics for dengue should be able to discriminate among the four antigenically related dengue serotypes and fulfill the requirements for successful decentralized (point-of-care) testing in the harsh environmental conditions found in most tropical regions. The accurate identification of circulating serotypes is crucial for the successful implementation of vector control programs based on reliable epidemiological predictions. This paper briefly summarizes the limitations of the main conventional techniques for biomolecular diagnosis of dengue disease and critically reviews some of the most relevant biosensors and rapid diagnostic tests developed, implemented and reported so far for point-of-care testing of dengue infections.

Progresses in these areas will be helpful to vaccine design and antiviral drugs discovery. Mass spectrometry based proteomics have shown exceptional display of capabilities, not only precisely identifying viral and cellular proteins that are functionally, structurally, and dynamically changed upon virus infection, but also enabling us to detect important pathway proteins. In addition, many isolation and purification techniques and quantitative strategies in conjunction with MS can significantly improve the sensitivity of mass spectrometry for detecting low-abundant proteins, replenishing the stock of virus proteome and enlarging the protein–protein interaction maps. Nevertheless, only a small proportion of the infectious viruses in both of animal and plant have been studied using this approach.

This report describes a virus identification method featuring high throughput, high resolution, and high sensitivity detection of viruses. Identification of virus is based on liquid hybridization of different lengths of virus-specific probes to their corresponding viruses. The probes bound to target sequences are removed by a biotin–streptavidin pull-down mechanism and the supernatant is analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. The probes depleted from the sample appear as diminished peaks in the electropherograms and the remaining probes serve as calibrators to align peaks in different capillaries. The virus identities are unraveled by a signal processing and peak detection algorithm developed in-house. Nine viruses were used in the study to demonstrate how the system works to unravel the virus identity in single and double virus infections. With properly designed probes, the system is able to distinguish closely related viruses. The system takes advantage of the high resolution feature of capillary electrophoresis to resolve probes that differ by length.

However, because OSD is incapable of signal amplification, the signal-to-noise ratio or the observable signal change may be usually not significant enough to satisfy practical usage. With the purpose to overcome this challenge, herein a more advanced and practical sensing principle is developed with the OSD replaced by an amplifiable nucleic acid circuit, hybridization chain reaction (HCR). The very contagious norovirus (NoV) was employed as the model target. Compared with LAMP-OSD, the LAMP-HCR can detect as few as 30 copies of NoV gene in 2% fecal samples with significantly enlarged signal change and signal-to-background ratio. Therefore, more reliable detection is achieved. Moreover, due to the high compatibility of HCR, the final LAMP-HCR products can be flexibly transduced into different types of readouts, including fluorescence, flow cytometer (FCM) and even a personal glucose meter (PGM). This further enlarges the operating environments for the detection from hospital labs, bedsides, to potential off-the-shelf devices in local pharmacies.

Even though great progresses have been achieved in terms of target range and sensing principle, issues such as low final signal-to-background ratio and hard-to-realize one-tube smart analysis still exist and challenge real-world applications in gene detection. Here we propose a practical solution via coupling isothermal amplification (i.e. LAMP) and three-way amplifiable catalytic hairpin assembly (i.e. CHA) to a PGM. It allows direct transduction from genomic information to commercial portable devices with all of ultra-high sensitivity, specificity and enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Compared with previous report without signal amplification, the introduction of CHA has successfully improved the signal amplitude by at least 12.5 folds. More importantly, through importing an effective three-way junction based transduction, we also innovatively develop a one-tube logical or multiplex analysis strategy in PGM based detection. Totally four situations of two foodborne bacteria genes, in Cronobacter sakazakii (ompA) and Escherichia coli (malB), could be directly readout using the final PGM signals, with the lowest detection amount down to less than 100 molecular copies (6.6 × 10−18 M).

In this study, the cleavage mechanism of the SARS coronavirus main proteinase (Mpro or 3CLpro) on the octapeptide NH2-AVLQ↓SGFR-COOH was investigated using molecular mechanics and quantum mechanics simulations based on the experimental structure of the proteinase. It has been observed that the catalytic dyad (His-41/Cys-145) site between domains I and II attracts the π electron density from the peptide bond Gln–Ser, increasing the positive charge on C(CO) of Gln and the negative charge on N(NH) of Ser, so as to weaken the Gln–Ser peptide bond. The catalytic functional group is the imidazole group of His-41 and the S in Cys-145. Nδ1 on the imidazole ring plays the acid–base catalytic role. Based on the “distorted key theory” [K.C. Chou, Anal. Biochem. 233 (1996) 1–14], the possibility to convert the octapeptide to a competent inhibitor has been studied. It has been found that the chemical bond between Gln and Ser will become much stronger and no longer cleavable by the SARS enzyme after either changing the carbonyl group CO of Gln to CH2 or CF2 or changing the NH of Ser to CH2 or CF2.

It also allowed us to accurately determine the kinetic rate constants for the interaction between His-CypA and CsA. His-CypA was first captured on a Ni2+–nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) sensor chip and was then briefly covalently stabilized, coupling via primary amines. The significant baseline drift observed due to dissociation of weakly bound His-CypA from the Ni2+–NTA moiety was eliminated, resulting in a surface that was stable for at least 36h. In addition, immobilized protein activity levels were high, typically between 85 and 95%, assayed by the interaction between His-CypA and CsA.

A typical example is the case of display of peptides longer than 6 amino acid residues on the major coat protein, protein VIII of the filamentous bacteriophages M13 and fd. A solution to this problem has been the use of “two-gene systems” generating chimeric phages that concomitantly express wild-type protein VIII along with recombinant protein VIII. Although the two-gene systems are much more permissive in regard to insert length and composition, some cases can still adversely affect phage assembly. Although these phages genotypically contain the desired DNA of the insert, they appear to be phenotypically wild type. To avoid false-negative results when using chimeric phages in binding studies, it is necessary to confirm that the observed lack of phage recognition is not due to faulty assembly and display of the intended insert. Here we describe a strategy for generating antibodies that specifically recognize recombinant protein VIII regardless of the nature of its foreign insert. These antibodies can be used as a general monitor of the display of recombinant protein VIII into phage particles.",2012-01-01,"Kaplan, Gilad; Gershoni, Jonathan M.",Analytical Biochemistry,,,True,custom_license

Our understanding of these keystone individuals is largely taken from meticulous field observations and semi-scientific anecdotes. In this study we experimentally test whether the behavioural tendencies of putative keystone individuals shift the collective behaviour of colonies using the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola. Prior studies on Stegodyphus demonstrated that the single best predictor of colonies' collective behaviour is the behaviour of colonies' boldest individual. Here, we probe the causal relationship between the traits of extremely bold individuals and colonies' collective behaviour by experimentally creating colonies of identical size and personality composition in the laboratory and then adding a single individual of varying boldness (the putative keystone individual). Experimentally adding just one extremely bold individual increased the foraging aggressiveness of entire colonies and altered the total mass gained by fellow group members, relative to the addition of a less bold individual. Additionally, our data suggest that bold individuals are capable of such influence because they catalyse variation in the behavioural tendencies of fellow group members.",2014-07-31,"Pruitt, Jonathan N.; Keiser, Carl N.",Animal Behaviour,,,True,custom_license

La sécurité virale des médicaments repose sur trois éléments : la qualité de la matière première, le procédé de fabrication qui inclue des étapes aptes à éliminer ou à inactiver les virus et, éventuellement, les contrôles des produits intermédiaires ou finis. La qualité de la matière première est désormais aisément garantie, pour les MDS, par le screening des dons de sang ou de plasma (screening individuel ou en pool) pour les marqueurs directs (antigènes, génomes) et indirects (anticorps) de virus majeurs. La succession d’étapes de purification des principes actifs (étapes de partition), d’étapes d’inactivation des virus (traitement solvant–détergent, chauffage) et d’étapes dédiées spécifiquement à l’élimination des virus (nanofiltration) au cours du procédé de fabrication permet de réduire considérablement le risque viral. Cette réduction peut être estimée quantitativement lors des études de validation par épreuves de surcharge à échelle réduite. Les contrôles virologiques sur produits intermédiaires ou sur produits finis permettent de conforter la sécurité virale d’un médicament lorsque les contributions des deux premiers éléments, qualité de la matière première et procédé de fabrication, paraissent insuffisants. Le développement des principes et des techniques de sécurisation des médicaments d’origine biologique permet désormais de garantir au mieux l’absence d’infectiosité liée à des virus connus mais également, par anticipation, de garantir l’absence d’infectiosité liée à des virus inconnus. Summary The viral safety of biologicals, either human blood derivatives or animal products or recombinant proteins issued from biotechnology, relies on the quality of the starting material, the manufacturing process and, if necessary, the control of the final product. The quality of the starting material is highly guaranteed for blood derivatives due to the individual screening for specific markers (antigens, genome, antibodies) for major blood borne viruses such as hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It can be reinforced by the detection through amplification procedures (polymerase chain reaction) in the plasma pool of genomes from viruses that have been implicated in contaminations of blood derivatives in the past (parvovirus B19, hepatitis A virus). The association in the manufacturing process of different steps dedicated to purification of plasma proteins (partitioning), virus inactivation (solvent/detergent treatment, heat inactivation) or specific procedures allowing virus removal (nanofiltration) allows to reduce the viral risk very efficiently. The validation studies using scaled down systems and model viruses allow to evaluate the virus safety of any product quantitatively. The aim of these procedures is to guarantee the lack of infectivity due to any virus, either known or unknown.",2008-06-30,"Barin, F.",Annales Pharmaceutiques Françaises,,,True,custom_license

Le vaccin est un médicament qui a la particularité de s’adresser à des sujets bien portants. Les principes actifs qui le composent sont issus d’organismes vivants et se différencient de ceux de la chimie classique par leurs structures moléculaires souvent complexes et parfois mal identifiées. Les propriétés de la préparation vaccinale dépendent étroitement du procédé de production mis en œuvre et il est commun d’admettre que « le procédé fait le produit ». La fabrication s’effectue en zones confinées, due aux caractères pathogènes de la plupart des microorganismes impliqués. Les matières premières sont soumises à des contrôles rigoureux afin de garantir l’intégrité des produits vis-à-vis de contaminants viraux ou d’agents transmissibles non conventionnels comme le prion. L’industrie du vaccin est caractérisée par la longueur des cycles de production. La complexité des produits implique celle des contrôles qualité dont l’activité représente en moyenne 75 % de la durée du cycle total de fabrication. En tant qu’élément majeur de santé publique, le monde du vaccin est soumis à des à-coups de production en fonction de la demande extérieure, en particulier dans les contextes d’épidémie ou de menaces de bioterrorisme. En parallèle, l’industrie du vaccin doit intégrer les exigences toujours plus pressantes des autorités de santé.

Summary The industrial development of vaccine manufacturing expanded during the second half of the 20th century. Vaccines are medicines which target healthy people. The active principles of vaccines arise from live organisms and can be distinguished from standard pharmaceutical compounds by their extreme complexity. The properties of vaccines depend mainly of the manufacturing process and it common to state that “the process makes the product”. The manufacturing is done in confined rooms because of the pathogenic characters of the organisms involved. Raw materials are subjected to rigorous controls to guarantee the integrity of products towards non-conventional agents like prion. The vaccine industry is characterized by the length of the manufacturing cycle. The complexity of the products implies heavy quality controls, which represent 75% of the total duration of the manufacture cycle. As a key element of public health, the vaccine production can be subjected to variations and adaptations, in particular in the context of outbreaks or bioterrorism. The vaccine industry must integrate the regulatory requirements, which are more and more pressing. The spectacular development of the quality assurance and quality control departments these last 15 years testifies to this evolution.",2009-05-31,"Speck, D.",Annales Pharmaceutiques Françaises,,,True,custom_license

We further showed that M protein-induced apoptosis involved mitochondrial release of cytochrome c protein, and could be suppressed by caspase inhibitors. Over-expression of M caused a dominant rough-eye phenotype in adult Drosophila. By performing a forward genetic modifier screen, we identified phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) as a dominant suppressor of M-induced apoptotic cell death.

Its physiological role is to regulate the concentrations of choline and glycine betaine in the blood and cells. Choline is important for regulation of gene expression, the biosynthesis of lipoproteins and membrane phospholipids and for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine; glycine betaine plays important roles as a primary intracellular osmoprotectant and as methyl donor for the biosynthesis of methionine from homocysteine, a required step for the synthesis of the ubiquitous methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine. Recently, CHD has generated considerable medical attention due to its association with various human pathologies, including male infertility, homocysteinuria, breast cancer and metabolic syndrome.

This makes amyloid fibrils a challenging focus for inhibition studies because the peptides and proteins that form amyloid fibrils cannot be targeted based on a sequence motif. Most peptide inhibitors that target specific amyloidogenic proteins rely heavily on sequence recognition to ensure that the inhibitory peptide is able to bind its target. This approach is limited to targeting one amyloidogenic protein at a time. However, there is increasing evidence of cross-reactivity between amyloid-forming polypeptides. It has therefore become more useful to study the similarities between these proteins that goes beyond their sequence homology. Indeed, the observation that amyloidogenic proteins adopt similar secondary structures along the pathway to fibril formation opens the way to an interesting investigation: the development of inhibitors that could be universal amyloid traps.

Pathogen invasion tipically triggers an inflammatory response where acute phase proteins (APP) have a key role.

Although high APP levels have been broadly associated with bacterial infections, there is a growing body of evidence revealing increased PTX, CRP and SAP expression upon viral infection. Furthermore, CRP, PTX and SAP have shown their potential as diagnostic markers and predictors of disease outcome. Likewise, the measurement of APP levels can be valuable to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies and vaccines. From the practical point of view, the ability of APP to reduce viral infectivity has been observed in several virus-host models. This has prompted investigation efforts to assess the role of acute phase response proteins as immunoregulatory molecules and their potential as therapeutic reagents.

Impact of a viral respiratory epidemic on the practice of medicine and rehabilitation: severe acute respiratory syndrome. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2004;85:1365–70. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new respiratory viral epidemic that originated in China but has affected many parts of the world, with devastating impact on economies and the practice of medicine and rehabilitation. A novel coronavirus has been implicated, with transmission through respiratory droplets. Rehabilitation was significantly affected by SARS, because strict infection control measures run counter to principles such as multidisciplinary interactions, patients encouraging and learning from each other, and close physical contact during therapy. Immunocompromised patients who may silently carry SARS are common in rehabilitation and include those with renal failure, diabetes, and cancer. Routine procedures such as management of feces and respiratory secretions (eg, airway suctioning, tracheotomy care) have been classified as high risk. Personal protection equipment presented not only a physical but also a psychologic barrier to therapeutic human contact.

To construct the lipid raft model, the surface pressure (π)–molecular area (A) and surface potential (ΔV)–A isotherms for three-component (PSM/DOPC/CHOL) systems on 0.02M Tris buffer with 0.13M NaCl (pH7.4) were primarily measured by changing their compositions. Thermodynamic and interaction parameters for binary PSM/DOPC and PSM/CHOL systems revealed that PSM interacts more strongly with CHOL than with DOPC. In addition, a morphological analysis performed with Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) and fluorescence microscopy (FM) revealed an optimal ratio of PSM/DOPC/CHOL (1/1/1, by mole) as a model of lipid rafts. Second, the interaction of GC with the ternary PSM/DOPC/CHOL monolayers was investigated on Tris buffer solutions containing different GC concentrations (1, 5, 10, 25, and 50μM). In BAM and FM images, microdomains were found to become smaller by increasing the GC concentration in the subphase, suggesting that GC regulates the size of raft domains, which provide dynamic scaffolding for numerous cellular processes. More interestingly, the distinctive GC striped regions were formed at the interface at 50μM, which shows that GC divides the ternary monolayer into pieces. This phenomenon was observed only in the presence of CHOL in the monolayer. These results suggest that CHOL plays an essential role in the interaction with GC, which results in one of the major activities associated with saponins' membrane disruption.",2013-04-30,"Sakamoto, Seiichi; Nakahara, Hiromichi; Uto, Takuhiro; Shoyama, Yukihiro; Shibata, Osamu",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes,,,True,custom_license

A locus located between the spike and envelope genes is conserved in all coronaviruses and contains a complete or truncated open reading frame (ORF). Previously, we demonstrated that this locus, which contains the gene for accessory protein 3a from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), encodes a protein that forms ion channels and regulates virus release. In the current study, we explored whether the ORF4a protein of HCoV-229E has similar functions. Our findings revealed that the ORF4a proteins were expressed in infected cells and localized at the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). The ORF4a proteins formed homo-oligomers through disulfide bridges and possessed ion channel activity in both Xenopus oocytes and yeast. Based on the measurement of conductance to different monovalent cations, the ORF4a was suggested to form a non-selective channel for monovalent cations, although Li+ partially reduced the inward current. Furthermore, viral production decreased when the ORF4a protein expression was suppressed by siRNA in infected cells. Collectively, this evidence indicates that the HCoV-229E ORF4a protein is functionally analogous to the SARS-CoV 3a protein, which also acts as a viroporin that regulates virus production.

Our previous studies have shown the colocalization of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) with the early endosome marker EEA1 and the inhibition of NDV fusion by the caveolin-phosphorylating drug phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) prompted us to propose that NDV enters the cells via endocytosis. Here we show that the virus-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion promoted by NDV-F are increased by about 30% after brief exposure to low pH in HeLa and ELL-0 cells but not in NDV receptor- deficient cell lines such as GM95 or Lec1. After a brief low-pH exposure, the percentage of NDV fusion at 29 °C was similar to that at 37 °C without acid-pH stimulation, meaning that acid pH would decrease the energetic barrier to enhance fusion. Furthermore, preincubation of cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide led to the inhibition of about 30% of NDV infectivity, suggesting that a population of virus enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, the involvement of the GTPase dynamin in NDV entry is shown as its specific inhibitor, dynasore, also impaired NDV fusion and infectivity. Optimal infection of the host cells was significantly affected by drugs that inhibit endosomal acidification such as concanamycin A, monensin and chloroquine. These results support our hypothesis that entry of NDV into ELL-0 and HeLa cells occurs through the plasma membrane as well as by dynamin- low pH- and receptor- dependent endocytosis.",2014-01-31,"Sánchez-Felipe, Lorena; Villar, Enrique; Muñoz-Barroso, Isabel",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes,,,True,custom_license

In this review, we discuss the discovery, antiviral activity and mechanism of action of such peptides. While peptide entry inhibitors have been discovered by a wide variety of approaches (structure-based, accidental, intentional, rational and brute force) we show here that they share a common physical chemical property: they are at least somewhat hydrophobic and/or amphipathic and have a propensity to interact with membrane interfaces. We propose that this propensity drives a shared mechanism of action for many peptide entry inhibitors, involving direct interactions with viral and cellular membranes, as well as interactions with the complex hydrophobic protein/lipid interfaces that are exposed, at least transiently, during virus–cell fusion. By interacting simultaneously with the membrane interfaces and other critical hydrophobic surfaces, we hypothesize that peptide entry inhibitors can act by changing the physical chemistry of the membranes, and the fusion protein interfaces bridging them, and by doing so interfere with the fusion of cellular and viral membranes. Based on this idea, we propose that an approach that focuses on the interfacial hydrophobicity of putative entry inhibitors could lead to the efficient discovery of novel, broad-spectrum viral entry inhibitors.

The S2 subunit of the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV carries out fusion between the virus and the host cells. However, the exact mechanism of the cell fusion process is not well understood. Current model suggests that a conformational transition, upon receptor recognition, of the two heptad core regions of S2 may expose the hydrophobic fusogenic peptide or fusion peptide for membrane insertion. Three regions of the S2 subunit have been proposed to be involved in cell–cell fusion. The N-terminal fusion peptide (FP, residues 770–788), an internal fusion peptide (IFP, residues 873–888) and the pre-transmembrane region (PTM, residues 1185–1202) demonstrated interactions with model lipid membranes and potentially involved in the fusion process. Here, we have determined atomic resolution structures of these three peptides in DPC detergent micelles by solution NMR. FP assumes α-helical conformation with significant distortion at the central Gly residues; enabling a close packing among sidechains of aromatic residues including W, Y and F. The 3-D structure of PMT is characterized by a helix–loop–helix with extensive aromatic interactions within the helices. IFP adopts a rather straight α-helical conformation defined by packing among sidechains of aromatic and aliphatic residues.

All bundles tend to turn into a compact structure during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Gromos96 (ffG45a3)) in hydrated lipid bilayers, as well as when simulated at ‘low pH’, which may trigger channel opening according to some functional studies. Both GT 1a and 1b channel models are gated via movement of the parallel aligned helices, yet the scenario for the GT 5a protein is more complex, with a short N-terminal helix being involved.

Usually they are small and have to assemble to form channels which depolarize the lipid membrane of the host cells. Structural information is just about to emerge for just some of them. Thus, computational methods play a pivotal role in generating plausible structures which can be used in the drug development process. In this review the accumulation of structural data is introduced from a historical perspective. Computational performances and their predictive power are reported guided by biological questions such as the assembly, mechanism of function and drug–protein interaction of VCPs. An outlook of how coarse grained simulations can contribute to yet unexplored issues of these proteins is given. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane Proteins edited by J.C.

A successful viral infection requires fusion between virus and host cells carried out by the surface spike glycoprotein or S protein of CoV. Current models propose that the S2 subunit of S protein assembled into a hexameric helical bundle exposing hydrophobic fusogenic peptides or fusion peptides (FPs) for membrane insertion. The N-terminus of S2 subunit of SARS-CoV reported to be active in cell fusion whereby FPs have been identified. Atomic-resolution structure of FPs derived either in model membranes or in membrane mimic environment would glean insights toward viral cell fusion mechanism. Here, we have solved 3D structure, dynamics and micelle localization of a 64-residue long fusion peptide or LFP in DPC detergent micelles by NMR methods. Micelle bound structure of LFP is elucidated by the presence of discretely folded helical and intervening loops. The C-terminus region, residues F42-Y62, displays a long hydrophobic helix, whereas the N-terminus is defined by a short amphipathic helix, residues R4-Q12. The intervening residues of LFP assume stretches of loops and helical turns. The N-terminal helix is sustained by close aromatic and aliphatic sidechain packing interactions at the non-polar face. 15N{1H}NOE studies indicated dynamical motion, at ps-ns timescale, of the helices of LFP in DPC micelles. PRE NMR showed that insertion of several regions of LFP into DPC micelle core.

In this study, we have characterized the mechanism of membrane interaction of a short, 9-residue peptide TK9 (T55VYVYSRVK63) that had been derived from the carboxyl terminal of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) corona virus (SARS CoV) envelope (E) protein. The peptide has been studied for its physical changes in the presence of both zwitterionic DPC and negatively charged SDS model membrane micelles, respectively, with the help of a battery of biophysical techniques including two-dimensional solution state NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, in both micellar environments, TK9 adopted an alpha helical conformation; however, the helical propensities were much higher in the case of DPC compared to those of SDS micelle, suggesting that TK9 has more specificity towards eukaryotic cell membrane than the bacterial cell membrane. The orientation of the peptide TK9 also varies in the different micellar environments. The peptide's affinity was further manifested by its pronounced membrane disruption ability towards the mammalian compared to the bacterial membrane mimic. Collectively, the in-depth structural information on the interaction of TK9 with different membrane environments explains the host specificity and membrane orientation owing to subsequent membrane disruption implicated in the viral pathogenesis.",2018-02-28,"Ghosh, Anirban; Bhattacharyya, Dipita; Bhunia, Anirban",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes,,,True,custom_license

This makes TAP an important target for viruses avoiding recognition by CD8+ T lymphocytes. Its activity can be suppressed by the UL49.5 protein produced by bovine herpesvirus 1, although the mechanism of this inhibition has not been understood so far. Therefore, the main goal of our study was to investigate the 3D structure of bovine herpesvirus 1 - encoded UL49.5 protein. The final structure of the inhibitor was established using circular dichroism (CD), 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and molecular dynamics (MD) in membrane mimetic environments. In NMR studies, UL49.5 was represented by two fragments: the extracellular region (residues 1–35) and the transmembrane-intracellular fragment (residues 36–75), displaying various functions during viral invasion. After the empirical structure determination, a molecular docking procedure was used to predict the complex of UL49.5 with the TAP heterodimer. Our results revealed that UL49.5 adopted a highly flexible membrane-proximal helical structure in the extracellular part. In the transmembrane region, we observed two short α-helices. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic part had an unordered structure. Finally, we propose three different orientations of UL49.5 in the complex with TAP.

These two AMPs effectively inhibit the growth of human pathogenic fungi in micromolar concentrations and exhibit antiviral potential without causing cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. The antifungal mechanism of action of both AMPs is closely linked to - but not solely dependent on - the lipid composition of the fungal cell membrane and requires a strictly regulated protein uptake into the cell, indicating that PAF and PAFB are not canonical membrane active proteins. Variations in their antifungal spectrum and their killing dynamics point towards a divergent mode of action related to their physicochemical properties and surface charge distribution. In this review, we relate characteristic features of PAF and PAFB to the current knowledge about other AMPs of different sources. In addition, we present original data that have never been published before to substantiate our assumptions and provide evidences that help to explain and understand better the mechanistic function of PAF and PAFB.

The plasma membrane-bound carboxypeptidase activity which occurs at neutral optimum pH levels was found to be enhanced by CoCl2 and inhibited by guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, o-phenanthroline, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and cadmium acetate; whereas the soluble carboxypeptidase activity which occurs at an optimum pH level of 5.0 was not activated by CoCl2 and only slightly inhibited by o-phenanthroline, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, NiCl2 and CdCl2. The latter activity was presumably due to lysosomal cathepsin B, which is known to be present in the soluble fraction of hog intestinal mucosa. Although the membrane-bound enzyme was evenly distributed along the small intestine, it was not anchored in the phospholipidic bilayer via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moiety, as carboxypeptidase M from human placenta is. The enzyme was not solubilized by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, but was solubilized to practically the same extent by several detergents. The purified trypsin-solubilized form is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 200 kDa, as determined by performing SDS–PAGE and gel filtration, which differs considerably from the molecular mass of human placental carboxypeptidase M (62 kDa). It was found to cleave lysyl bonds more rapidly than arginyl bonds, which is not so in the case of carboxypeptidase M, and immunoblotting analysis provided further evidence that hog intestinal and human placental membrane-bound carboxypeptidases do not bear much resemblance to each other. Since the latter enzyme has been called carboxypeptidase M, it is suggested that the former might be carboxypeptidase D, the recently described new member of the carboxypeptide B-type family.",1999-10-15,"Dalle Ore, Florence; Ajandouz, El Hassan; Giardina, Thierry; Puigserver, Antoine",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes,,,True,custom_license

Its envelope contains the E1 and E2 glycoproteins, disulfide linked into homo- and heterodimers. In this study, we investigate the role of disulfide bond formation in the folding, assembly, and stability of BVDV glycoproteins. We provide molecular evidence that intact disulfide bonds are critical for the acquirement of a stable conformation of E2 monomers. Forcing the E2 glycoproteins to adopt a reduced conformation either co- or post-translationally before assembly into dimers, determines their misfolding and degradation by proteasome. In contrast, dimerization of E2 glycoproteins results in a conformation resistant to reducing agents and degradation. Furthermore, inhibition of the ER-α-mannosidase activity leads to impairment of misfolded E2 degradation, demonstrating the involvement of this enzyme in targeting viral proteins towards proteasomal degradation.",2002-08-16,"Branza-Nichita, Norica; Lazar, Catalin; Durantel, David; Dwek, Raymond A; Zitzmann, Nicole",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,True,custom_license

We found that the amount of transcription factors binding to promoter sequences of c-Fos, ATF2, CREB-1, and FosB was increased by the expression of SARS-CoV N. Since these factors are related to AP-1 signal transduction pathway, we investigated whether the AP-1 pathway was activated by SARS-CoV N protein using the PathDetect system.

SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an enveloped RNA virus, which contains several structural proteins. Among these proteins, spike (S) protein is responsible for binding to specific cellular receptors and is a major antigenic determinant, which induces neutralizing antibody. In order to analyze the antigenicity and receptor-binding ability of SARS-CoV S protein, we expressed the S protein in Escherichia coli using a pET expression vector. After the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside induction, S protein was expressed in the soluble form and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography to homogeneity. The amount of S protein recovered was 0.2–0.3mg/100ml bacterial culture. The S protein was recognized by sera from SARS patients by ELISA and Western blot, which indicated that recombinant S protein retained its antigenicity. By biotinylated ELISA and Western blot using biotin-labeled S protein as the probe, we identified 130-kDa and 140-kDa proteins in Vero cells that might be the cellular receptors responsible for SARS-CoV infection. Taken together, these results suggested that recombinant S protein exhibited the antigenicity and receptor-binding ability, and it could be a good candidate for further developing SARS vaccine and anti-SARS therapy.",2004-01-23,"Ho, Tin-Yun; Wu, Shih-Lu; Cheng, Shin-Ei; Wei, Yen-Chiao; Huang, Shan-Ping; Hsiang, Chien-Yun",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,True,custom_license

The ACE2 sequence is similar (sequence identities 43% and 35%, and similarities 61% and 55%, respectively) to those of the testis-specific form of ACE (tACE) and the Drosophila homolog of ACE (AnCE). The high level of sequence similarity allowed us to build a robust homology model of the ACE2 structure with a root-mean-square deviation from the aligned crystal structures of tACE and AnCE less than 0.5Å. A prominent feature of the model is a deep channel on the top of the molecule that contains the catalytic site. Negatively charged ridges surrounding the channel may provide a possible binding site for the positively charged receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-glycoprotein, which we recently identified [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 312 (2003) 1159]. Several distinct patches of hydrophobic residues at the ACE2 surface were noted at close proximity to the charged ridges that could contribute to binding.

The genome of SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has recently been sequenced, and a number of genes identified, including that of the nucleocapsid protein (N). It is noted, however, that the N protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV N) shares little homology with nucleocapsid proteins of other members of the coronavirus family [Science 300 (2003) 1399; Science 300 (2003) 1394]. N proteins of other coronavirus have been reported to be involved in forming the viral core and also in the packaging and transcription of the viral RNA. As data generated from some viral systems other than coronaviruses suggested that viral N–N self-interactions may be necessary for subsequent formation of the nucleocapsid and assembly of the viral particles, we decided to investigate SARS-CoV N–N interaction. By using mammalian two-hybrid system and sucrose gradient fractionations, a homotypic interaction of N, but not M, was detected by the two-hybrid analysis. The mammalian two-hybrid assay revealed an approximately 50-fold increase in SEAP activity (measurement of protein–protein interaction) in N–N interaction compared to that observed in either M–M or mock transfection. Furthermore, mutational analyses characterized that a serine/arginine-rich motif (SSRSSSRSRGNSR) between amino acids 184 and 196 is crucial for N protein oligomerization, since deletion of this region completely abolished the N protein self-multimerization. Finally, the full-length nucleocapsid protein expressed and purified from baculovirus system was found to form different levels of higher order structures as detected by Western blot analysis of the fractionated proteins.

The virus is a novel coronavirus isolated from patients exhibiting atypical pneumonia and may have originated from wild animals such as civet cats in southern China. The genome of SARS-CoV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA whose sequence is distantly related to all known coronaviruses that infect humans and animals. Like other known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus containing three outer structural proteins, namely the membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins. The nucleocapsid (N) protein together with the viral RNA genome presumably form a helical core located within the viral envelope. The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is a 423 amino-acid, predicted phospho-protein of 46kDa that shares little homology with other members of the coronavirus family. A short serine-rich stretch, and a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal are unique to it, thus suggesting its involvement in many important functions during the viral life cycle. In this report we have cloned the N gene of the SARS coronavirus, and studied its property of self-association to form dimers. We expressed the N protein as a fusion protein in the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate self-association and confirmed dimerization of the N protein from mammalian cell lysates by coimmunoprecipitation.

This protease easily dissociated into inactive monomer and the deduced K d of the dimer was 100μM. In order to detect enzyme activity, the assay needed to be performed at micromolar enzyme concentration. This makes finding the tight inhibitor (nanomolar range IC50) impossible.

The fluorogenic peptide gave extremely sensitive signal upon cleavage catalyzed by the protease. Using this substrate, the protease exhibits a significantly higher activity (k cat=1.9s−1 and K m =17 μ M) compared to the previously reported parameters.

Chem. 277 (2002) 19727] that the SU of a murine hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) forms dimers, the dimerization domain overlaps the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and that this dimeric state is important for binding to receptor molecules that initiates entry into cells. We have previously expressed various soluble fragments of the SARS-CoV SU and identified stably folded fragments (residues 272–537) that contain the RBD [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 312 (2003) 1159]. Here, we further characterize these and other fragments in an attempt to identify possible dimerization domains and their role for membrane fusion. We demonstrate that the SU and a shorter 260-amino acid N-terminal fragment (residues 17–276), which folds independently, form dimers. In contrast to the previously characterized MHV SU dimerization, this fragment is upstream and distinct from the RBD. Its deletion abolished S-mediated cell membrane fusion but retained the SU-receptor-binding function indicating the possibility for a role in post-receptor binding steps of the virus entry mechanism. Interestingly, the whole soluble S ectodomain (Se) that contains the dimerization domain but not the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail forms trimers suggesting the existence of a trimerization domain in the TM subunit in its prefusion state that may lead to a conformation unfavorable for formation of higher-order multimeric structures. These results demonstrate the existence of SU dimers and Se trimers, and indicate the possibility for an unknown mechanism of their role in entry. They also further characterize the S-mediated membrane fusion and could be important for understanding the mechanisms of virus entry, and in the development of therapeutics and vaccines.",2004-09-10,"Xiao, Xiaodong; Feng, Yang; Chakraborti, Samitabh; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,True,custom_license

ProS is subsequently processed into two C-terminal proteins of ∼110 and ∼80kDa. The membrane-bound proprotein convertases (PCs) furin, PC7 or PC5B enhanced the production of the ∼80kDa protein. In agreement, proS processing, cytopathic effects, and viral titers were enhanced in recombinant Vero E6 cells overexpressing furin, PC7 or PC5B.

At 12h post-infection, the intracellular viral RNA load was 3×102-fold higher than at the time of infection, and the extracellular viral RNA load was increased with a factor of 2×103. Intracellular viral RNA levels started to rise at 6h post-infection. One hour later (at 7h post-infection), the levels of extracellular SARS-CoV RNA also began to rise. This was corroborated by the fact that infectious progeny SARS-CoV also first appeared in the supernatant between 6 and 7h post-infection. At 12h post-infection, SARS-CoV reached titers in the supernatant of 5.2×103 CCID50/ml.",2005-04-15,"Keyaerts, Els; Vijgen, Leen; Maes, Piet; Neyts, Johan; Ranst, Marc Van",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,True,custom_license

A positive correlation between the ratio of target gene versus siRNA and the suppression of SPAG9 expression was observed. Further, the cotransfection of BS/U6/spag9 with pcDNA-SPAG9 and pFlag-CMV2-JNK-3 resulted in specific suppression of SPAG9 without affecting JNK-3 expression.

Coincidently, the receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues 318–510) of SAR-CoV S protein is a major antigenic site to induce neutralizing antibodies. Here, we used RBD-Fc, a fusion protein containing the RBD and human IgG1 Fc, as a model in the studies and found that a single amino acid substitution in the RBD (R441A) could abolish the immunogenicity of RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice and rabbits. With a panel of anti-RBD mAbs as probes, we observed that R441A substitution was able to disrupt the majority of neutralizing epitopes in the RBD, suggesting that this residue is critical for the antigenic structure responsible for inducing protective immune responses. We also demonstrated that the RBD-Fc bearing R441A mutation could not bind to soluble and cell-associated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and failed to block S protein-mediated pseudovirus entry, indicating that this point mutation also disrupted the receptor-binding motif (RBM) in the RBD.

The key challenge for achieving effective gene silencing in particular for the purpose of the therapeutics is primarily dependent on the effectiveness and specificity of the RNAi targeting sequence. However, only a limited number of siRNAs is capable of inducing highly effective and sequence-specific gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism. In addition, the efficacy of siRNA-induced gene silencing can only be experimentally measured based on inhibition of the target gene expression. Therefore, it is important to establish a fully robust and comparative validating system for determining the efficacy of designed siRNAs. In this study, we have developed a reliable and quantitative reporter-based siRNA validation system that consists of a short synthetic DNA fragment containing an RNAi targeting sequence of interest and two expression vectors for targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expression. The efficacy of the siRNAs is measured by their abilities to inhibit expression of the targeting reporter gene with easily quantified readouts including enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and firefly luciferase. Using fully analyzed siRNAs against human hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) and tumor suppressor protein p53, we have demonstrated that this system could effectively and faithfully report the efficacy of the corresponding siRNAs. In addition, we have further applied this system for screening and identification of the highly effective siRNAs that could specifically inhibit expression of mouse matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), and human serine/threonine kinase AKT1. Since only a readily available short synthetic DNA fragment is needed for constructing this novel reporter-based siRNA validation system, this system not only provides a powerful strategy for screening highly effective siRNAs but also implicates in the use of RNAi for studying novel gene function in mammals.",2006-08-04,"Hung, Chuan-Fu; Lu, Kuang-Chu; Cheng, Tsung-Lin; Wu, Ren-Huang; Huang, Lin-Ya; Teng, Chiao-Fang; Chang, Wen-Tsan",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,True,custom_license

In this study, we investigated which signaling pathways play important roles in escape from apoptosis in cells infected with SARS-CoV. In persistently infected cells at 50h.p.i., PI3K/Akt, JNK, p38 MAPK and Bcl-2 were phosphorylated and the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were increased. When surviving cells were treated with the JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125, at 50h.p.i., all cells died, suggesting that the JNK signaling pathway is necessary for maintenance of persistently infected cells. Among the signaling pathways in persistently infected cells, Akt and JNK were phosphorylated in SARS-CoV-nucleocapsid (N) protein-expressing Vero E6 cells using vaccinia viral vector (DIs), strongly suggesting that N protein-induced phosphorylation of Akt and JNK are necessary to establish persistence.

The capsid (Cp) of WNV is thought to play a role in inducing these symptoms through caspase-3- and caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. Using WNVCp as bait for a yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified that Hsp70 interacted with WNVCp. The interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp was further substantiated using purified proteins. Deletion analysis of Hsp70 indicated that WNVCp could bind to the substrate binding domain of Hsp70. The presence of WNVCp in the Hsp70-dependent folding system inhibited the refolding of β-galactosidase (β-gal), which showed that WNVCp might function as a negative regulator of Hsp70. Finally, the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp in 293T cells was prevented by ectopic Hsp70, suggesting a negative regulatory role of Hsp70 on WNVCp.

In this study, RNA aptamers against SCV NTPase/Helicase (nsP10) were isolated from RNA library containing random sequences of 40 nts using in vitro selection technique. Nucleotide sequences of enriched RNA aptamer pool (ES15 RNA) contain AG-rich conserved sequence of 10–11 nucleotides [AAAGGR(G)GAAG; R, purine base] and/or additional sequence of 5 nucleotides [GAAAG], which mainly reside at the loop region in all the predicted secondary structures. Isolated RNAs were observed to efficiently inhibit double-stranded DNA unwinding activity of the helicase by up to ∼85% with an IC50 value of 1.2nM but show a slight effect on ATPase activity of the protein in the presence of cofactor, poly (rU). These results suggest that the pool of selected aptamers might be potentially useful as anti-SCV agents.",2008-02-15,"Jang, Kyoung Jin; Lee, Na-Ra; Yeo, Woon-Seok; Jeong, Yong-Joo; Kim, Dong-Eun",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,True,custom_license

Nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV encapsidates the viral RNA and plays an important role in virus particle assembly and release. In this study, the N protein of SARS-CoV was found to associate with B23, a phosphoprotein in nucleolus, in vitro and in vivo. Mapping studies localized the critical N sequences for this interaction to amino acid residues 175–210, which included a serine/arginine (SR)-rich domain. In vitro phosphorylation assay showed that the N protein inhibited the B23 phosphorylation at Thr199.",2008-05-02,"Zeng, Yingchun; Ye, Linbai; Zhu, Shengli; Zheng, Hong; Zhao, Peng; Cai, Weijia; Su, Liya; She, Yinglong; Wu, Zhenghui",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,True,custom_license

Here, we report that lipid rafts in Vero E6 cells are involved in the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Infectivity assay showed the integrity of lipid rafts was required for productive infection of pseudotyped SARS-CoV. Depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol with MβCD relocalized raft-resident marker caveolin-1 as well as SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 to a nonraft environment, but did not significantly change the surface expression of ACE2. MβCD-treatment inhibited infectivity of pseudotyped SARS-CoV by 90%. Biochemical fractionation and confocal imaging confirmed that ACE2 colocalized with raft-resident markers. Furthermore, an ectodomain of SARS-CoV S protein (S1188HA) could associate with lipid rafts after binding to its receptor, and colocalize with raft-resident marker ganglioside GM1. The binding of S1188HA was not affected by depleting plasma membrane cholesterol. Taken together, our results support that lipid rafts serve as an entry port for SARS-CoV.",2008-05-02,"Lu, Yanning; Liu, Ding Xiang; Tam, James P.",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,True,custom_license

By using commercial M13 phage library, single plaque isolation of 38 phages was done and binding affinities were investigated with phage-ELISA. The specificities of the selected phage clones showing high affinity to SEB were checked by using different protein molecules which can be found in food samples. Furthermore, the affinities of three selected phage clones were determined by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors. Sequence analysis was realized for three peptides showing high binding affinity to SEB and WWRPLTPESPPA, MNLHDYHRLFWY, and QHPQINQTLYRM amino acid sequences were obtained. The peptide sequence with highest affinity to SEB was synthesized with solid phase peptide synthesis technique and thermodynamic constants of the peptide–SEB interaction were determined by using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and compared with those of antibody–SEB interaction. The binding constant of the peptide was determined as 4.2±0.7×105 M−1 which indicates a strong binding close to that of antibody.",2008-05-23,"Soykut, Esra Acar; Dudak, Fahriye Ceyda; Boyacı, İsmail Hakkı",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,True,custom_license

We used H5N1 pseudotyped and reverse-genetics (RG) virus particles to study their ability to bind with DC-SIGN. Electronic microscopy and functional assay results indicate that pseudotyped viruses containing both HA and NA proteins express hemagglutination and are capable of infecting cells expressing α-2,3-linked sialic acid receptors. Results from a capture assay show that DC-SIGN-expressing cells (including B-THP-1/DC-SIGN and T-THP-1/DC-SIGN) and peripheral blood dendritic cells are capable of transferring H5N1 pseudotyped and RG virus particles to target cells; this action can be blocked by anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies. In summary, (a) DC-SIGN acts as a capture or attachment molecule for avian H5N1 virus, and (b) DC-SIGN mediates infections in cis and in trans.",2008-09-05,"Wang, Sheng-Fan; Huang, Jason C.; Lee, Yuan-Ming; Liu, Shih-Jen; Chan, Yu-Jiun; Chau, Yat-Pang; Chong, Pele; Chen, Yi- Ming Arthur",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,True,custom_license

A safer in vitro system is desirable for conducting research on SARS-CoV and to screen for antiviral drugs against the virus. Based on the infectious cDNA clone of rSARS-CoV-ΔE, in which the E gene has been deleted, a safe non-infectious replicon was constructed by replacing the S gene with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene. Successful replication was achieved as evident from continuous expression of eGFP detected by both fluorescence and Western blot. Treatment with antiviral drugs demonstrated that the replication could be significantly inhibited by 0.4mg/ml of cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64D, but not by ribavirin. The same replicons containing further deletion of the coding regions for non-structural proteins (nsp) 1, 2 or 16 confirmed previous observation that nsp16, but not nsp1 or nsp2, was essential for efficient viral replication or transcription.",2008-09-12,"Wang, Jian-Min; Wang, Lin-Fa; Shi, Zheng-Li",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,True,custom_license

In this study, we selected seven epitopes from the spike (S1), spike (S2), and nucleocapsid (N) protein and constructed a multi-epitope DNA vaccine. The 7-day-old chickens were immunized intramuscularly with multi-epitope DNA vaccine encapsulated by liposome and boosted two weeks later, and were challenged by virulent IBV strain five weeks post booster. The results showed that multi-epitope DNA vaccine led to a dramatic augmentation of humoral and cellular responses, and provided up to 80.0% rate of immune protection. The novel immunogenic chimeric multi-epitope DNA vaccine revealed in this study provided a new candidate target for IBV vaccine development.",2008-12-05,"Tian, Lang; Wang, Hong-ning; Lu, Dan; Zhang, Yun-fei; Wang, Ting; Kang, Run-ming",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,True,custom_license
